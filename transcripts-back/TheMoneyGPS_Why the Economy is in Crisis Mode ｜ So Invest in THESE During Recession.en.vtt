00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.910 align:start position:0%
could come up considerably or we could
have<00:01:32.460><c> the</c><00:01:32.880><c> markets</c><00:01:33.360><c> trade</c><00:01:33.780><c> sideways</c><00:01:34.500><c> until</c>

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
have the markets trade sideways until
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start position:0%
have the markets trade sideways until
that<00:01:35.400><c> does</c><00:01:35.579><c> happen</c><00:01:35.880><c> because</c><00:01:36.240><c> of</c><00:01:36.479><c> inflation</c><00:01:37.020><c> or</c>

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
that does happen because of inflation or
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.850 align:start position:0%
that does happen because of inflation or
markets<00:01:38.640><c> can</c><00:01:38.759><c> come</c><00:01:39.060><c> down</c><00:01:39.299><c> a</c><00:01:39.600><c> bit</c><00:01:39.780><c> and</c><00:01:40.439><c> so</c><00:01:40.619><c> the</c>

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
markets can come down a bit and so the
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 align:start position:0%
markets can come down a bit and so the
this<00:01:41.159><c> is</c><00:01:41.340><c> where</c><00:01:41.520><c> we</c><00:01:41.640><c> are</c><00:01:41.820><c> at</c><00:01:41.939><c> right</c><00:01:42.119><c> now</c><00:01:42.240><c> it's</c>

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
this is where we are at right now it's
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.569 align:start position:0%
this is where we are at right now it's
not<00:01:42.540><c> just</c><00:01:42.720><c> profits</c><00:01:43.439><c> of</c><00:01:43.560><c> course</c><00:01:43.680><c> but</c><00:01:44.100><c> look</c><00:01:44.340><c> at</c>

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
not just profits of course but look at
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.710 align:start position:0%
not just profits of course but look at
what<00:01:44.880><c> happens</c><00:01:45.180><c> with</c><00:01:46.020><c> calls</c><00:01:46.799><c> calls</c><00:01:47.759><c> are</c><00:01:48.119><c> bets</c>

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
what happens with calls calls are bets
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.710 align:start position:0%
what happens with calls calls are bets
that<00:01:49.140><c> the</c><00:01:49.380><c> market</c><00:01:49.500><c> will</c><00:01:50.040><c> go</c><00:01:50.280><c> up</c><00:01:50.520><c> all</c><00:01:51.000><c> right</c><00:01:51.180><c> and</c>

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
that the market will go up all right and
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.569 align:start position:0%
that the market will go up all right and
so<00:01:51.899><c> we</c><00:01:52.020><c> have</c><00:01:52.140><c> puts</c><00:01:52.619><c> which</c><00:01:52.979><c> is</c><00:01:53.100><c> the</c><00:01:53.340><c> exact</c>

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
so we have puts which is the exact
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 align:start position:0%
so we have puts which is the exact
opposite<00:01:54.060><c> bets</c><00:01:54.540><c> that</c><00:01:54.659><c> the</c><00:01:54.840><c> market</c><00:01:54.960><c> will</c><00:01:55.259><c> come</c>

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
opposite bets that the market will come
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 align:start position:0%
opposite bets that the market will come
down<00:01:55.680><c> but</c><00:01:56.100><c> here</c><00:01:56.340><c> you</c><00:01:56.820><c> could</c><00:01:56.939><c> see</c><00:01:57.119><c> it</c><00:01:57.240><c> for</c>

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
down but here you could see it for
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.069 align:start position:0%
down but here you could see it for
yourself<00:01:57.799><c> U.S</c><00:01:58.799><c> call</c><00:01:59.159><c> volume</c><00:01:59.460><c> has</c><00:02:00.079><c> exploded</c>

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
yourself U.S call volume has exploded
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.810 align:start position:0%
yourself U.S call volume has exploded
this<00:02:01.680><c> year</c><00:02:01.860><c> and</c><00:02:02.759><c> so</c><00:02:03.119><c> usually</c><00:02:03.899><c> the</c><00:02:04.740><c> market</c><00:02:04.979><c> is</c>

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
this year and so usually the market is
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.350 align:start position:0%
this year and so usually the market is
the<00:02:06.180><c> exact</c><00:02:06.600><c> opposite</c><00:02:07.200><c> of</c><00:02:07.560><c> what</c><00:02:07.799><c> it</c><00:02:07.920><c> should</c><00:02:08.099><c> be</c>

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
the exact opposite of what it should be
 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.570 align:start position:0%
the exact opposite of what it should be
and<00:02:09.360><c> so</c><00:02:09.599><c> when</c><00:02:09.899><c> everybody's</c><00:02:10.440><c> piling</c><00:02:10.800><c> in</c><00:02:10.979><c> into</c>

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
and so when everybody's piling in into
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.869 align:start position:0%
and so when everybody's piling in into
the<00:02:11.940><c> calls</c><00:02:12.680><c> it's</c><00:02:13.680><c> usually</c><00:02:14.220><c> going</c><00:02:14.520><c> to</c><00:02:14.640><c> go</c><00:02:14.760><c> the</c>

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
the calls it's usually going to go the
 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.430 align:start position:0%
the calls it's usually going to go the

other direction that doesn't mean it's a

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
no no what it means is that the the
 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.890 align:start position:0%
no no what it means is that the the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
trade is too crowded at this time and so
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 align:start position:0%
trade is too crowded at this time and so
the<00:02:25.140><c> smart</c><00:02:25.319><c> investors</c><00:02:25.980><c> start</c><00:02:26.280><c> looking</c><00:02:26.640><c> at</c>

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
happen but that's what goes on so we
 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.330 align:start position:0%
happen but that's what goes on so we
