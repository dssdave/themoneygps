00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
well I want to note a few things the
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.749 align:start position:0%
well I want to note a few things the
very<00:00:27.199><c> first</c><00:00:28.080><c> is</c><00:00:28.599><c> that</c><00:00:28.800><c> the</c><00:00:28.920><c> US</c><00:00:29.240><c> economy</c><00:00:29.560><c> takes</c>

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 align:start position:0%
very first is that the US economy takes
 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.630 align:start position:0%
very first is that the US economy takes
a<00:00:30.039><c> step</c><00:00:30.480><c> backward</c><00:00:31.080><c> in</c><00:00:31.480><c> April</c><00:00:32.480><c> and</c><00:00:32.840><c> we</c><00:00:33.000><c> can</c><00:00:33.239><c> see</c>

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
a step backward in April and we can see
 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.709 align:start position:0%
a step backward in April and we can see
that<00:00:33.840><c> of</c><00:00:34.000><c> course</c><00:00:34.320><c> demand</c><00:00:34.760><c> is</c><00:00:34.920><c> weakening</c><00:00:35.480><c> but</c>

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 align:start position:0%
that of course demand is weakening but
 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.590 align:start position:0%
that of course demand is weakening but
why<00:00:35.879><c> is</c><00:00:36.040><c> that</c><00:00:36.239><c> the</c><00:00:36.399><c> case</c><00:00:36.879><c> I</c><00:00:36.960><c> mean</c><00:00:37.160><c> are</c><00:00:37.360><c> people</c>

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
why is that the case I mean are people
 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.470 align:start position:0%
why is that the case I mean are people
suddenly<00:00:38.360><c> just</c><00:00:38.640><c> like</c><00:00:39.000><c> you</c><00:00:39.120><c> know</c><00:00:39.320><c> practicing</c>

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
suddenly just like you know practicing
 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.389 align:start position:0%
