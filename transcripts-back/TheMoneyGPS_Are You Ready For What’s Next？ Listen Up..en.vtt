being up yes certainly overall but why
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.050 align:start position:0%
being up yes certainly overall but why
because<00:01:33.119><c> people</c><00:01:33.420><c> were</c><00:01:33.720><c> paying</c><00:01:34.259><c> more</c><00:01:34.500><c> for</c><00:01:34.920><c> gas</c>

it okay so they've been doing a lot of
different<00:03:38.099><c> things</c><00:03:38.400><c> not</c><00:03:38.700><c> like</c><00:03:38.879><c> a</c><00:03:39.120><c> huge</c><00:03:39.300><c> bazooka</c>

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
different things not like a huge bazooka
 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.110 align:start position:0%
different things not like a huge bazooka
but<00:03:40.200><c> they</c><00:03:40.379><c> have</c><00:03:40.500><c> definitely</c><00:03:40.799><c> been</c><00:03:41.099><c> doing</c><00:03:41.400><c> a</c>

but they have definitely been doing a
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.369 align:start position:0%
but they have definitely been doing a
bunch<00:03:42.239><c> of</c><00:03:42.360><c> different</c><00:03:42.480><c> things</c><00:03:42.720><c> now</c><00:03:42.959><c> here</c><00:03:43.200><c> is</c>

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 align:start position:0%
bunch of different things now here is
 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.470 align:start position:0%
bunch of different things now here is
the<00:03:43.620><c> Resurgence</c><00:03:44.220><c> and</c><00:03:44.819><c> this</c><00:03:45.000><c> is</c><00:03:45.060><c> showing</c><00:03:45.360><c> us</c>

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
the Resurgence and this is showing us
 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.210 align:start position:0%
the Resurgence and this is showing us
the<00:03:45.860><c> PPI</c><00:03:47.000><c> ppi</c><00:03:48.000><c> is</c><00:03:48.299><c> the</c><00:03:48.599><c> producer</c><00:03:49.200><c> price</c><00:03:49.620><c> index</c>

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
the PPI ppi is the producer price index
 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.890 align:start position:0%
the PPI ppi is the producer price index
so<00:03:50.459><c> this</c><00:03:50.700><c> is</c><00:03:50.819><c> like</c>

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
so this is like
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
so this is like
think<00:03:52.319><c> of</c><00:03:52.500><c> it</c><00:03:52.620><c> like</c><00:03:52.739><c> raw</c><00:03:53.099><c> materials</c><00:03:53.640><c> yes</c><00:03:54.299><c> the</c>

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
think of it like raw materials yes the
 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.890 align:start position:0%
think of it like raw materials yes the
CPI<00:03:55.440><c> that's</c><00:03:56.400><c> going</c><00:03:56.640><c> to</c><00:03:56.819><c> be</c><00:03:57.060><c> you</c><00:03:57.420><c> as</c><00:03:57.659><c> the</c>

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
CPI that's going to be you as the
 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.770 align:start position:0%
CPI that's going to be you as the
consumer<00:03:58.379><c> what</c><00:03:58.860><c> kind</c><00:03:59.040><c> of</c><00:03:59.159><c> inflation</c><00:03:59.700><c> you</c><00:04:00.540><c> deal</c>

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
consumer what kind of inflation you deal
 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.890 align:start position:0%
consumer what kind of inflation you deal
with<00:04:01.019><c> but</c><00:04:01.860><c> the</c><00:04:02.220><c> producers</c><00:04:02.819><c> that</c><00:04:03.480><c> might</c><00:04:03.659><c> be</c>

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
with but the producers that might be
 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.589 align:start position:0%
with but the producers that might be
like<00:04:04.200><c> copper</c><00:04:04.980><c> that</c><00:04:05.280><c> might</c><00:04:05.459><c> be</c><00:04:05.640><c> the</c><00:04:05.879><c> iron</c><00:04:06.060><c> ore</c>

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
like copper that might be the iron ore
 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.930 align:start position:0%
like copper that might be the iron ore
that<00:04:06.959><c> might</c><00:04:07.080><c> be</c><00:04:07.200><c> like</c><00:04:07.440><c> the</c><00:04:07.739><c> raw</c><00:04:07.980><c> material</c><00:04:08.459><c> and</c>

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
that might be like the raw material and
 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.509 align:start position:0%
that might be like the raw material and
then<00:04:09.060><c> they</c><00:04:09.420><c> produce</c><00:04:09.840><c> a</c><00:04:10.260><c> product</c><00:04:10.439><c> that</c><00:04:11.040><c> the</c><00:04:11.280><c> end</c>

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
then they produce a product that the end
 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.330 align:start position:0%
then they produce a product that the end
consumer<00:04:12.299><c> will</c><00:04:12.900><c> then</c><00:04:13.080><c> purchase</c><00:04:13.560><c> a</c><00:04:14.099><c> lot</c><00:04:14.220><c> of</c>

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
consumer will then purchase a lot of
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.710 align:start position:0%
consumer will then purchase a lot of
stuff<00:04:14.459><c> is</c><00:04:14.700><c> you</c><00:04:14.939><c> know</c><00:04:15.000><c> made</c><00:04:15.120><c> up</c><00:04:15.239><c> just</c><00:04:15.420><c> like</c><00:04:15.599><c> the</c>

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
stuff is you know made up just like the
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.229 align:start position:0%
stuff is you know made up just like the
CPI<00:04:16.199><c> there's</c><00:04:16.560><c> goes</c><00:04:17.220><c> a</c><00:04:17.400><c> lot</c><00:04:17.519><c> of</c><00:04:17.579><c> it</c><00:04:17.699><c> goes</c><00:04:18.060><c> into</c>

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
CPI there's goes a lot of it goes into
 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.550 align:start position:0%
CPI there's goes a lot of it goes into
that<00:04:18.479><c> but</c>

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
that but
 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.229 align:start position:0%
that but
um<00:04:19.620><c> just</c><00:04:19.919><c> in</c><00:04:20.160><c> general</c><00:04:20.340><c> we</c><00:04:20.760><c> could</c><00:04:20.880><c> see</c><00:04:21.000><c> that</c>

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
um just in general we could see that
 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.230 align:start position:0%
um just in general we could see that
this<00:04:21.419><c> has</c><00:04:21.720><c> now</c><00:04:22.019><c> again</c><00:04:22.919><c> two</c><00:04:23.520><c> months</c><00:04:23.820><c> in</c><00:04:23.940><c> a</c><00:04:24.060><c> row</c>

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
happened with the CPI and I looked at
 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.909 align:start position:0%
happened with the CPI and I looked at
the<00:04:37.680><c> Resurgence</c><00:04:38.160><c> there</c><00:04:38.600><c> also</c><00:04:39.600><c> again</c><00:04:39.960><c> we</c><00:04:40.740><c> are</c>

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 align:start position:0%
the Resurgence there also again we are
 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.370 align:start position:0%
the Resurgence there also again we are
seeing<00:04:41.220><c> the</c><00:04:41.460><c> same</c><00:04:41.580><c> thing</c><00:04:41.820><c> pop</c><00:04:42.120><c> up</c><00:04:42.300><c> two</c><00:04:43.080><c> months</c>

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
seeing the same thing pop up two months
 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.310 align:start position:0%

in<00:04:43.560><c> a</c><00:04:43.680><c> row</c><00:04:43.860><c> for</c><00:04:44.460><c> the</c><00:04:44.639><c> PPI</c><00:04:45.240><c> does</c><00:04:45.780><c> this</c><00:04:45.900><c> mean</c><00:04:46.139><c> that</c>

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
in a row for the PPI does this mean that
 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.890 align:start position:0%
in a row for the PPI does this mean that
we<00:04:46.560><c> are</c><00:04:46.740><c> now</c><00:04:47.040><c> going</c><00:04:47.280><c> to</c><00:04:47.520><c> see</c><00:04:47.900><c> further</c>
