more than ever this year and that is
 

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
more than ever this year and that is
absolutely<00:09:36.040><c> true</c><00:09:36.240><c> because</c><00:09:36.440><c> they're</c><00:09:36.680><c> watching</c>

that and the expectation is perhaps
 

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
that and the expectation is perhaps

but<00:09:59.399><c> this</c><00:09:59.600><c> is</c><00:10:00.000><c> very</c><00:10:00.360><c> important</c><00:10:00.920><c> because</c>

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
but this is very important because
 

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.990 align:start position:0%
but this is very important because
they're<00:10:02.040><c> looking</c><00:10:02.560><c> closely</c><00:10:03.240><c> very</c><00:10:03.480><c> closely</c><00:10:03.839><c> at</c>

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking closely very closely at
 

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
they're looking closely very closely at
the<00:10:04.399><c> FED</c><00:10:05.399><c> no</c><00:10:05.560><c> matter</c><00:10:05.800><c> where</c><00:10:05.920><c> you</c><00:10:06.040><c> are</c><00:10:06.240><c> around</c>

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
the FED no matter where you are around
 

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.269 align:start position:0%
the FED no matter where you are around
the<00:10:06.560><c> world</c><00:10:06.800><c> because</c><00:10:07.120><c> a</c><00:10:07.240><c> lot</c><00:10:07.360><c> of</c><00:10:07.560><c> their</c><00:10:07.800><c> action</c>

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
the world because a lot of their action
 

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:10.269 align:start position:0%
the world because a lot of their action
then<00:10:08.560><c> oh</c><00:10:08.839><c> okay</c><00:10:09.120><c> the</c><00:10:09.240><c> FED</c><00:10:09.519><c> did</c><00:10:09.640><c> it</c><00:10:09.839><c> okay</c><00:10:10.000><c> now</c><00:10:10.160><c> we</c>

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
then oh okay the FED did it okay now we
 

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
then oh okay the FED did it okay now we
can<00:10:10.399><c> do</c><00:10:10.560><c> it</c><00:10:10.800><c> that</c><00:10:11.000><c> that</c><00:10:11.120><c> was</c><00:10:11.279><c> happening</c><00:10:11.560><c> a</c><00:10:11.720><c> lot</c>

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
can do it that that was happening a lot
 

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.430 align:start position:0%
can do it that that was happening a lot
um<00:10:12.839><c> during</c><00:10:13.120><c> this</c><00:10:13.519><c> previous</c>

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
um during this previous
 

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.590 align:start position:0%
um during this previous
cycle<00:10:15.440><c> and</c><00:10:15.640><c> seeing</c><00:10:16.000><c> where</c><00:10:16.160><c> we</c><00:10:16.240><c> are</c><00:10:16.560><c> right</c><00:10:16.760><c> now</c>

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
cycle and seeing where we are right now
 

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.630 align:start position:0%
cycle and seeing where we are right now
it<00:10:17.800><c> looks</c><00:10:18.200><c> like</c><00:10:18.399><c> I</c><00:10:18.440><c> mean</c><00:10:18.600><c> you</c><00:10:18.680><c> could</c><00:10:18.880><c> measure</c>

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
it looks like I mean you could measure
 

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.870 align:start position:0%
it looks like I mean you could measure
interest<00:10:20.040><c> rates</c><00:10:20.880><c> in</c><00:10:21.040><c> different</c><00:10:21.320><c> ways</c><00:10:21.760><c> we</c>

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
interest rates in different ways we
 

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.030 align:start position:0%
interest rates in different ways we
could<00:10:22.079><c> look</c><00:10:22.399><c> at</c><00:10:23.000><c> the</c><00:10:23.160><c> FED</c><00:10:23.360><c> funds</c><00:10:23.600><c> rate</c><00:10:23.839><c> for</c>

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
could look at the FED funds rate for
 

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.110 align:start position:0%
could look at the FED funds rate for
instance<00:10:24.440><c> obviously</c><00:10:25.120><c> but</c><00:10:25.279><c> we</c><00:10:25.399><c> can</c><00:10:25.600><c> look</c><00:10:25.880><c> at</c>

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
instance obviously but we can look at
 

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.269 align:start position:0%
instance obviously but we can look at
the<00:10:26.279><c> bond</c><00:10:26.560><c> market</c><00:10:27.279><c> so</c><00:10:27.480><c> this</c><00:10:27.560><c> is</c><00:10:27.680><c> the</c><00:10:27.800><c> two-year</c>

00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
the bond market so this is the two-year
 

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.269 align:start position:0%
the bond market so this is the two-year
Treasury<00:10:29.160><c> and</c><00:10:29.279><c> you</c><00:10:29.440><c> see</c><00:10:29.640><c> that</c><00:10:29.720><c> it</c><00:10:29.839><c> peaked</c><00:10:30.079><c> out</c>

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
Treasury and you see that it peaked out
 

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:33.350 align:start position:0%
Treasury and you see that it peaked out
approximately<00:10:30.839><c> 5%</c><00:10:31.839><c> so</c><00:10:32.079><c> there</c><00:10:32.200><c> it</c><00:10:32.360><c> was</c><00:10:32.519><c> at</c><00:10:32.760><c> 5%</c>

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 5% so there it was at 5%
 

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.389 align:start position:0%
approximately 5% so there it was at 5%
people<00:10:33.560><c> were</c><00:10:33.920><c> putting</c><00:10:34.200><c> their</c><00:10:34.320><c> money</c><00:10:34.640><c> in</c><00:10:35.240><c> and</c>

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
people were putting their money in and
 

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:36.949 align:start position:0%
people were putting their money in and
it<00:10:35.519><c> was</c><00:10:35.639><c> the</c><00:10:35.760><c> same</c><00:10:35.880><c> for</c><00:10:36.079><c> even</c><00:10:36.279><c> shorter</c><00:10:36.680><c> term</c>

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
it was the same for even shorter term
 

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:40.030 align:start position:0%
it was the same for even shorter term
debt<00:10:37.560><c> so</c><00:10:37.720><c> you</c><00:10:37.880><c> were</c><00:10:38.079><c> getting</c><00:10:38.639><c> really</c><00:10:39.279><c> good</c>

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
debt so you were getting really good
 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.590 align:start position:0%
debt so you were getting really good
rates<00:10:40.360><c> of</c><00:10:40.720><c> return</c><00:10:41.560><c> on</c><00:10:41.839><c> short-term</c><00:10:42.440><c> debt</c><00:10:43.440><c> and</c>

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
rates of return on short-term debt and
 

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.230 align:start position:0%
rates of return on short-term debt and
that's<00:10:43.959><c> really</c><00:10:44.279><c> important</c><00:10:44.639><c> to</c><00:10:44.760><c> note</c><00:10:45.680><c> um</c><00:10:45.959><c> but</c>

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's really important to note um but
 

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
that's really important to note um but
it<00:10:46.399><c> has</c><00:10:46.639><c> definitely</c><00:10:46.959><c> come</c><00:10:47.160><c> down</c><00:10:47.320><c> so</c><00:10:47.440><c> we'll</c><00:10:47.600><c> see</c>

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
it has definitely come down so we'll see
 

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.670 align:start position:0%
it has definitely come down so we'll see
you<00:10:47.839><c> know</c><00:10:47.959><c> as</c><00:10:48.079><c> it</c><00:10:48.200><c> fluctuates</c><00:10:48.639><c> and</c><00:10:48.760><c> so</c><00:10:48.880><c> on</c><00:10:49.560><c> uh</c>

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know as it fluctuates and so on uh
 

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.990 align:start position:0%
you know as it fluctuates and so on uh
where<00:10:49.880><c> it</c><00:10:50.079><c> goes</c><00:10:50.959><c> but</c><00:10:51.160><c> that</c><00:10:51.320><c> is</c><00:10:51.440><c> an</c><00:10:51.639><c> important</c>

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
where it goes but that is an important
 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.949 align:start position:0%
where it goes but that is an important
thing<00:10:52.519><c> because</c><00:10:53.120><c> when</c><00:10:53.279><c> you</c><00:10:53.399><c> get</c><00:10:53.639><c> more</c>

00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
thing because when you get more
 

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:57.069 align:start position:0%
thing because when you get more
attractive<00:10:54.519><c> rates</c><00:10:54.920><c> on</c><00:10:55.279><c> bonds</c><00:10:56.200><c> money</c><00:10:56.560><c> can</c><00:10:56.760><c> move</c>
