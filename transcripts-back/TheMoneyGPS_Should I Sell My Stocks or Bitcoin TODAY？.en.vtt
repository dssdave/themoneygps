00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
Nvidia was a recent example of this and
 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.350 align:start position:0%
Nvidia was a recent example of this and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
so he was getting 13 million 13 million
 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.710 align:start position:0%
