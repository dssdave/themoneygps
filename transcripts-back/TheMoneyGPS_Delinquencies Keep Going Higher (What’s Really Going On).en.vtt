come on we know that they're not we know
 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.309 align:start position:0%
come on we know that they're not we know
that<00:04:01.120><c> and</c><00:04:01.200><c> so</c><00:04:01.519><c> this</c><00:04:01.640><c> is</c><00:04:01.920><c> where</c><00:04:02.480><c> there's</c><00:04:03.079><c> um</c>

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
that and so this is where there's um
 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.910 align:start position:0%
that and so this is where there's um
certainly<00:04:03.879><c> this</c><00:04:04.319><c> the</c><00:04:04.760><c> the</c><00:04:04.920><c> risk</c><00:04:05.280><c> factor</c><00:04:06.120><c> okay</c>

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 align:start position:0%

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
um what's going to happen so I I don't
 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.630 align:start position:0%
um what's going to happen so I I don't
like<00:04:08.519><c> to</c><00:04:08.640><c> speculate</c><00:04:09.079><c> too</c><00:04:09.280><c> much</c><00:04:09.959><c> uh</c><00:04:10.200><c> but</c>

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
like to speculate too much uh but
 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.550 align:start position:0%
like to speculate too much uh but
certainly<00:04:11.319><c> if</c><00:04:11.519><c> interest</c><00:04:11.879><c> rates</c><00:04:12.239><c> this</c><00:04:12.360><c> is</c><00:04:12.439><c> what</c>

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
certainly if interest rates this is what
 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.309 align:start position:0%
certainly if interest rates this is what
you<00:04:12.640><c> need</c><00:04:12.799><c> to</c><00:04:12.920><c> know</c><00:04:13.159><c> from</c><00:04:13.360><c> this</c><00:04:13.560><c> what's</c><00:04:13.720><c> the</c>

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
you need to know from this what's the
 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.830 align:start position:0%
you need to know from this what's the
takeaway<00:04:15.319><c> if</c><00:04:15.480><c> interest</c><00:04:15.879><c> rates</c><00:04:16.199><c> remain</c><00:04:16.440><c> high</c>

takeaway if interest rates remain high
 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.909 align:start position:0%
takeaway if interest rates remain high
they're<00:04:17.040><c> in</c><00:04:17.199><c> big</c><00:04:17.400><c> trouble</c><00:04:17.720><c> you</c><00:04:17.840><c> might</c><00:04:18.079><c> ask</c><00:04:18.440><c> why</c>

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 align:start position:0%
they're in big trouble you might ask why
 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.189 align:start position:0%
they're in big trouble you might ask why
like<00:04:19.199><c> why</c><00:04:19.560><c> why</c><00:04:19.680><c> is</c><00:04:19.880><c> that</c><00:04:20.239><c> really</c><00:04:20.519><c> a</c><00:04:20.759><c> problem</c><00:04:21.120><c> I</c>

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
like why why is that really a problem I
 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.510 align:start position:0%
like why why is that really a problem I
mean<00:04:21.320><c> if</c><00:04:21.440><c> there's</c><00:04:21.680><c> higher</c><00:04:21.959><c> interest</c><00:04:22.280><c> rates</c>

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
mean if there's higher interest rates
 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.550 align:start position:0%
mean if there's higher interest rates
they<00:04:22.639><c> could</c><00:04:22.759><c> charge</c><00:04:23.040><c> more</c><00:04:23.240><c> interest</c><00:04:23.720><c> right</c>

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
they could charge more interest right
 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.469 align:start position:0%
they could charge more interest right
look<00:04:25.199><c> what</c><00:04:25.479><c> happened</c><00:04:26.240><c> is</c><00:04:26.360><c> that</c><00:04:26.520><c> for</c><00:04:26.720><c> a</c><00:04:26.960><c> long</c>
