00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
would be sort of leveling out I guess
 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.990 align:start position:0%
would be sort of leveling out I guess
that's<00:06:54.240><c> what</c><00:06:54.479><c> their</c><00:06:54.660><c> intention</c><00:06:54.960><c> is</c><00:06:55.199><c> and</c><00:06:55.919><c> so</c><00:06:56.160><c> we</c>

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's what their intention is and so we
 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.029 align:start position:0%
that's what their intention is and so we
don't<00:06:57.120><c> know</c><00:06:57.240><c> for</c><00:06:57.539><c> sure</c><00:06:57.600><c> we</c><00:06:57.900><c> never</c><00:06:58.020><c> know</c><00:06:58.259><c> but</c><00:06:58.919><c> it</c>

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
don't know for sure we never know but it
 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.070 align:start position:0%
don't know for sure we never know but it
is<00:06:59.160><c> making</c><00:06:59.340><c> the</c><00:06:59.639><c> price</c><00:06:59.759><c> go</c><00:06:59.940><c> up</c><00:07:00.120><c> as</c><00:07:00.479><c> of</c><00:07:00.720><c> the</c><00:07:00.900><c> now</c>

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
is making the price go up as of the now
 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.890 align:start position:0%
is making the price go up as of the now
so<00:07:01.680><c> uh</c><00:07:02.160><c> you</c><00:07:02.759><c> know</c><00:07:02.880><c> people</c><00:07:03.180><c> are</c><00:07:03.419><c> feeling</c><00:07:03.600><c> that</c>

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
