here is that when we look in percentage
terms<00:08:30.919><c> it</c><00:08:31.039><c> can</c><00:08:31.240><c> go</c><00:08:31.479><c> up</c><00:08:31.759><c> an</c><00:08:32.159><c> infinite</c><00:08:33.080><c> percent</c>

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
terms it can go up an infinite percent
 

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
terms it can go up an infinite percent
but<00:08:34.240><c> it</c><00:08:34.360><c> can</c><00:08:34.560><c> only</c><00:08:34.880><c> go</c><00:08:35.200><c> down</c><00:08:35.760><c> a</c><00:08:36.080><c> maximum</c><00:08:36.760><c> of</c>

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
but it can only go down a maximum of
 

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.550 align:start position:0%
but it can only go down a maximum of
100%<00:08:38.680><c> so</c><00:08:38.919><c> look</c><00:08:39.080><c> how</c><00:08:39.719><c> skewed</c><00:08:40.719><c> we</c><00:08:40.919><c> we</c><00:08:41.080><c> look</c><00:08:41.279><c> we</c><00:08:41.399><c> go</c>

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
100% so look how skewed we we look we go
 

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.750 align:start position:0%
100% so look how skewed we we look we go

what do we know about bare markets they

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
are generally short they are generally
 

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.910 align:start position:0%
are generally short they are generally
very<00:09:38.200><c> violent</c><00:09:39.200><c> so</c><00:09:39.399><c> in</c><00:09:39.519><c> terms</c><00:09:39.760><c> of</c><00:09:40.040><c> points</c><00:09:40.800><c> you</c>

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
very violent so in terms of points you
 

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.870 align:start position:0%
very violent so in terms of points you
got<00:09:41.040><c> to</c><00:09:41.200><c> look</c><00:09:41.360><c> at</c><00:09:41.720><c> that</c><00:09:42.720><c> in</c><00:09:42.920><c> in</c><00:09:43.040><c> the</c><00:09:43.240><c> example</c>

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
got to look at that in in the example
 

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
got to look at that in in the example
here<00:09:44.519><c> if</c><00:09:44.640><c> I</c><00:09:44.760><c> put</c><00:09:44.920><c> the</c><00:09:45.040><c> mouse</c><00:09:45.399><c> over</c><00:09:45.600><c> it</c><00:09:45.760><c> just</c>

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
here if I put the mouse over it just
 

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.430 align:start position:0%
here if I put the mouse over it just
look<00:09:46.040><c> at</c><00:09:46.200><c> this</c><00:09:46.399><c> example</c><00:09:47.399><c> so</c><00:09:47.760><c> all</c><00:09:47.959><c> of</c><00:09:48.200><c> these</c>

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
look at this example so all of these
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
look at this example so all of these
years<00:09:49.440><c> I</c><00:09:49.600><c> guess</c><00:09:49.800><c> that</c><00:09:49.880><c> would</c><00:09:50.040><c> be</c><00:09:50.160><c> let's</c><00:09:50.320><c> say</c>

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
years I guess that would be let's say
 

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.389 align:start position:0%
years I guess that would be let's say
1980<00:09:52.040><c> all</c><00:09:52.279><c> the</c><00:09:52.480><c> way</c><00:09:52.920><c> through</c><00:09:53.920><c> into</c><00:09:54.839><c> probably</c>

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
1980 all the way through into probably
 

00:09:55.399 --> 00:10:00.710 align:start position:0%
1980 all the way through into probably
2000<00:09:56.399><c> so</c><00:09:56.640><c> the</c><00:09:56.959><c> market</c><00:09:57.480><c> gains</c><00:09:58.480><c> 22</c>

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
2000 so the market gains 22
 

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
2000 so the market gains 22
87<00:10:01.720><c> but</c><00:10:02.560><c> it</c><00:10:02.760><c> crashes</c><00:10:03.399><c> down</c>

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
87 but it crashes down
 

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:08.030 align:start position:0%
87 but it crashes down
1,200<00:10:06.279><c> in</c><00:10:06.399><c> a</c><00:10:06.640><c> period</c><00:10:07.000><c> of</c><00:10:07.160><c> you</c><00:10:07.279><c> know</c><00:10:07.519><c> whatever</c><00:10:07.839><c> a</c>

year or something so and then again it
 

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
year or something so and then again it

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
happens for financial crisis 2008 it
 

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.310 align:start position:0%
