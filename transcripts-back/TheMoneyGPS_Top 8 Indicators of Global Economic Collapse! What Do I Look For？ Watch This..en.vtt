seems like it's a lot more than

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
5% but let's be conservative and say
 

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.190 align:start position:0%

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're about twice a little more than

we're about twice a little more than

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's done so on a rather Grand scale

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
you it's hard to tell here but

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.269 align:start position:0%

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%

compared<00:13:26.639><c> to</c><00:13:26.880><c> what</c><00:13:27.079><c> we</c><00:13:27.360><c> could</c><00:13:27.760><c> have</c><00:13:28.480><c> at</c><00:13:28.639><c> this</c>

00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
compared to what we could have at this
time<00:13:29.160><c> so</c><00:13:29.320><c> we</c><00:13:29.639><c> really</c><00:13:29.959><c> need</c><00:13:30.240><c> that</c><00:13:30.360><c> to</c>

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
time so we really need that to
 

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.590 align:start position:0%
time so we really need that to
accelerate<00:13:31.000><c> in</c><00:13:31.079><c> the</c><00:13:31.240><c> US</c><00:13:31.959><c> hopefully</c><00:13:32.279><c> it</c><00:13:32.360><c> we'll</c>

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
accelerate in the US hopefully it we'll
 

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.069 align:start position:0%
accelerate in the US hopefully it we'll
do<00:13:32.800><c> so</c><00:13:33.480><c> I'm</c><00:13:33.600><c> not</c><00:13:33.800><c> really</c><00:13:34.160><c> convinced</c><00:13:34.680><c> about</c><00:13:34.880><c> it</c>

00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
do so I'm not really convinced about it
 

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:36.069 align:start position:0%
do so I'm not really convinced about it
but<00:13:35.199><c> we'll</c>

00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
but we'll
 

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:40.670 align:start position:0%
but we'll

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
see and these were the eight indicators
 

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.470 align:start position:0%
see and these were the eight indicators
that<00:13:40.839><c> I</c><00:13:40.959><c> believe</c><00:13:41.160><c> are</c><00:13:41.880><c> important</c><00:13:42.880><c> there</c><00:13:43.040><c> are</c>

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
