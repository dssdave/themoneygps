the first thing I want to look at is
 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.350 align:start position:0%
the first thing I want to look at is
this<00:00:44.280><c> you</c><00:00:44.399><c> can</c><00:00:44.520><c> see</c><00:00:44.719><c> the</c><00:00:45.039><c> back</c><00:00:45.399><c> toor</c><00:00:46.360><c> barometer</c>

this you can see the back toor barometer
 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.389 align:start position:0%
this you can see the back toor barometer
and<00:00:47.520><c> this</c><00:00:47.640><c> is</c><00:00:47.800><c> always</c><00:00:48.120><c> changing</c><00:00:49.120><c> uh</c><00:00:49.239><c> we've</c>

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 align:start position:0%
and this is always changing uh we've
 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.790 align:start position:0%
and this is always changing uh we've
seen<00:00:50.039><c> improvement</c><00:00:50.719><c> over</c><00:00:51.000><c> where</c><00:00:51.199><c> it</c><00:00:51.360><c> was</c>

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
seen improvement over where it was
 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.310 align:start position:0%
seen improvement over where it was
earlier<00:00:52.280><c> in</c><00:00:52.640><c> 2020</c><00:00:53.640><c> but</c><00:00:53.960><c> essentially</c>

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
49.7%<00:00:58.320><c> based</c><00:00:58.600><c> on</c><00:00:58.800><c> the</c><00:00:59.000><c> 10</c><00:00:59.320><c> City</c><00:00:59.960><c> average</c>

49.7% based on the 10 City average
occupancy<00:01:01.559><c> and</c><00:01:01.680><c> so</c><00:01:01.800><c> you</c><00:01:01.920><c> see</c><00:01:02.199><c> that</c><00:01:03.039><c> half</c><00:01:03.280><c> of</c>

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
occupancy and so you see that half of
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.670 align:start position:0%
occupancy and so you see that half of
the<00:01:03.719><c> people</c><00:01:04.239><c> are</c><00:01:04.559><c> back</c><00:01:04.839><c> to</c><00:01:05.040><c> work</c><00:01:05.280><c> from</c><00:01:05.519><c> where</c>
