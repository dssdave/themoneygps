00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
model isn't working, that means
 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
model isn't working, that means
essentially<00:01:08.400><c> that</c><00:01:09.119><c> people</c><00:01:09.439><c> have</c><00:01:09.680><c> this</c><00:01:10.000><c> idea</c>

and<00:01:11.200><c> they</c><00:01:11.439><c> want</c><00:01:11.600><c> a</c><00:01:11.840><c> lot</c><00:01:11.920><c> of</c><00:01:12.159><c> money</c><00:01:12.479><c> for</c><00:01:12.799><c> that</c>

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
and they want a lot of money for that
 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.310 align:start position:0%
and they want a lot of money for that
idea<00:01:13.600><c> to</c><00:01:13.840><c> then</c><00:01:14.080><c> go</c><00:01:14.240><c> and</c><00:01:14.479><c> build</c><00:01:14.720><c> a</c><00:01:14.960><c> business</c>

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
idea to then go and build a business
 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.950 align:start position:0%
idea to then go and build a business
around,<00:01:16.320><c> but</c><00:01:16.640><c> of</c><00:01:16.880><c> course</c><00:01:17.600><c> they</c><00:01:17.920><c> can't</c><00:01:18.320><c> get</c><00:01:18.640><c> the</c>

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
around, but of course they can't get the

around, but of course they can't get the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
funding. So, they are closing down or
 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.710 align:start position:0%
funding. So, they are closing down or
cutting<00:01:21.280><c> back.</c><00:01:21.759><c> And</c><00:01:21.920><c> that's</c><00:01:22.080><c> what</c><00:01:22.240><c> it</c><00:01:22.400><c> is</c><00:01:22.560><c> all</c>

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.310 align:start position:0%
cutting back. And that's what it is all
about<00:01:23.360><c> where</c><00:01:23.600><c> they</c><00:01:23.840><c> have</c><00:01:24.400><c> a</c><00:01:24.799><c> lot</c><00:01:25.360><c> thrown</c><00:01:25.759><c> up</c><00:01:26.080><c> at</c>

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
