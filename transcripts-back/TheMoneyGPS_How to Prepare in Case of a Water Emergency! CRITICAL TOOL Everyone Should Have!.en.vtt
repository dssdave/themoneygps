and the LifeStraw Universal Universal I
 

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.110 align:start position:0%

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
thought was the most interesting concept
 

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.790 align:start position:0%
thought was the most interesting concept
because<00:09:23.440><c> it</c><00:09:23.560><c> allows</c><00:09:23.920><c> you</c><00:09:24.079><c> to</c><00:09:24.200><c> put</c><00:09:24.360><c> a</c><00:09:24.440><c> filter</c>

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
because it allows you to put a filter
 

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.190 align:start position:0%
because it allows you to put a filter

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
onto any normal standard siiz bottle so
 

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.870 align:start position:0%
onto any normal standard siiz bottle so
you<00:09:28.279><c> could</c><00:09:28.480><c> take</c><00:09:28.640><c> one</c><00:09:28.760><c> of</c><00:09:28.880><c> those</c><00:09:29.480><c> plastic</c>

you could take one of those plastic
