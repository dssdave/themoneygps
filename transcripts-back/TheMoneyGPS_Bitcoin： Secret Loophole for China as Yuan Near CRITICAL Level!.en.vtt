the very bottom you're seeing
 

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
the very bottom you're seeing
cryptocurrencies<00:09:08.720><c> okay</c><00:09:08.959><c> it's</c><00:09:09.160><c> basically</c>

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies okay it's basically
 

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.910 align:start position:0%

zero<00:09:10.160><c> okay</c><00:09:10.279><c> for</c><00:09:10.519><c> the</c><00:09:11.360><c> to</c><00:09:11.560><c> round</c><00:09:11.839><c> it</c><00:09:12.040><c> off</c><00:09:12.320><c> there</c>

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
zero okay for the to round it off there
 

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.230 align:start position:0%
zero okay for the to round it off there
then<00:09:13.040><c> you</c><00:09:13.200><c> look</c><00:09:13.360><c> at</c><00:09:13.560><c> something</c><00:09:13.959><c> like</c><00:09:14.240><c> gold</c><00:09:15.120><c> and</c>

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.030 align:start position:0%
then you look at something like gold and
you<00:09:15.440><c> can</c><00:09:15.600><c> see</c><00:09:16.279><c> obviously</c><00:09:17.279><c> just</c><00:09:17.640><c> for</c><00:09:17.760><c> example</c>

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
you can see obviously just for example
 

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.590 align:start position:0%
you can see obviously just for example
in<00:09:18.200><c> this</c><00:09:18.360><c> situation</c><00:09:19.079><c> comparing</c><00:09:19.600><c> the</c><00:09:19.800><c> two</c>

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
in this situation comparing the two
 

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.910 align:start position:0%
in this situation comparing the two
where<00:09:20.880><c> it's</c><00:09:21.160><c> basically</c><00:09:22.120><c> nothing</c><00:09:23.079><c> versus</c><00:09:23.920><c> 49%</c>

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
where it's basically nothing versus 49%
 

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.190 align:start position:0%
where it's basically nothing versus 49%
so

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
so
these<00:09:27.200><c> these</c><00:09:27.440><c> things</c><00:09:27.760><c> should</c><00:09:28.040><c> show</c><00:09:28.360><c> you</c><00:09:29.040><c> how</c>

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
these these things should show you how
 

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.030 align:start position:0%
these these things should show you how
these<00:09:30.240><c> markets</c><00:09:30.880><c> can</c><00:09:31.120><c> be</c><00:09:31.360><c> moved</c><00:09:31.800><c> and</c>

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
these markets can be moved and
 

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.550 align:start position:0%
these markets can be moved and

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
manipulated it's going to be a lot
 

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.269 align:start position:0%

easier to move cryptocurrencies than it
 

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:38.509 align:start position:0%
easier to move cryptocurrencies than it
is<00:09:36.440><c> to</c><00:09:36.560><c> move</c><00:09:36.800><c> gold</c><00:09:37.200><c> that</c><00:09:37.360><c> could</c><00:09:37.560><c> mean</c><00:09:38.200><c> a</c>

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
is to move gold that could mean a
