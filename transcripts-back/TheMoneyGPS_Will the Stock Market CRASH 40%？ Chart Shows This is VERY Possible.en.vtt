show<00:01:46.759><c> you</c><00:01:46.920><c> another</c><00:01:47.159><c> chart</c><00:01:47.479><c> which</c><00:01:48.040><c> is</c><00:01:48.240><c> better</c>

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 align:start position:0%
show you another chart which is better
 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.030 align:start position:0%
show you another chart which is better
basically<00:01:49.079><c> we</c><00:01:49.240><c> had</c><00:01:49.360><c> some</c><00:01:49.759><c> stagnation</c><00:01:50.759><c> during</c>

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
basically we had some stagnation during
 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.910 align:start position:0%
basically we had some stagnation during
the<00:01:51.200><c> oil</c><00:01:51.479><c> shocks</c><00:01:52.479><c> era</c><00:01:53.119><c> and</c><00:01:53.439><c> you</c><00:01:53.560><c> will</c><00:01:53.880><c> see</c><00:01:54.240><c> that</c>

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
the oil shocks era and you will see that
 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
the oil shocks era and you will see that
relatively<00:01:55.680><c> at</c><00:01:55.799><c> least</c><00:01:56.000><c> based</c><00:01:56.240><c> on</c><00:01:56.399><c> this</c><00:01:56.560><c> chart</c>

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.190 align:start position:0%
relatively at least based on this chart
I<00:01:56.960><c> mean</c><00:01:57.560><c> it's</c><00:01:57.719><c> hard</c><00:01:57.920><c> to</c><00:01:58.039><c> see</c><00:01:58.320><c> here</c><00:01:58.680><c> but</c>

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
I mean it's hard to see here but
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.630 align:start position:0%
I mean it's hard to see here but
stagnation<00:02:00.119><c> that's</c><00:02:00.280><c> what</c><00:02:00.439><c> we</c><00:02:00.640><c> have</c><00:02:01.240><c> and</c><00:02:01.399><c> then</c>

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
stagnation that's what we have and then
 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.389 align:start position:0%
stagnation that's what we have and then
you<00:02:01.840><c> get</c><00:02:02.159><c> a</c><00:02:02.360><c> starting</c><00:02:03.360><c> little</c><00:02:03.759><c> runup</c><00:02:04.759><c> and</c><00:02:05.399><c> that</c>

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
you get a starting little runup and that
 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.830 align:start position:0%
you get a starting little runup and that
what<00:02:06.600><c> seems</c><00:02:06.960><c> to</c><00:02:07.079><c> be</c><00:02:07.240><c> a</c><00:02:07.320><c> little</c><00:02:07.560><c> blip</c><00:02:08.160><c> on</c><00:02:08.479><c> this</c>
