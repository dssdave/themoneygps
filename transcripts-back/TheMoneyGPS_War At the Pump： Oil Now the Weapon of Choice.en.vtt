00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
up that's one thing and they wouldn't do
 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.350 align:start position:0%
up that's one thing and they wouldn't do
that<00:03:41.959><c> if</c><00:03:42.120><c> they</c><00:03:42.280><c> didn't</c><00:03:42.640><c> have</c><00:03:42.799><c> to</c><00:03:43.280><c> because</c><00:03:43.920><c> it's</c>

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
that if they didn't have to because it's
 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.190 align:start position:0%
that if they didn't have to because it's
