below now I wanted you to know this
 

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.750 align:start position:0%
below now I wanted you to know this
because<00:11:10.140><c> we</c><00:11:10.740><c> can</c><00:11:10.860><c> see</c><00:11:10.980><c> the</c><00:11:11.160><c> world</c><00:11:11.279><c> changing</c>

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
because we can see the world changing
 

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.329 align:start position:0%
because we can see the world changing
and<00:11:12.000><c> there's</c><00:11:12.180><c> a</c><00:11:12.600><c> multi-polar</c><00:11:13.500><c> world</c><00:11:13.740><c> that</c><00:11:14.220><c> is</c>

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
and there's a multi-polar world that is
 

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:16.430 align:start position:0%
and there's a multi-polar world that is
being<00:11:14.519><c> developed</c><00:11:15.000><c> and</c><00:11:15.540><c> so</c><00:11:15.720><c> what</c><00:11:15.959><c> that</c><00:11:16.140><c> means</c>

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
being developed and so what that means
 

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.670 align:start position:0%
being developed and so what that means
is<00:11:16.800><c> you</c><00:11:17.519><c> might</c><00:11:17.700><c> have</c><00:11:17.940><c> the</c><00:11:18.300><c> Swift</c><00:11:18.480><c> system</c><00:11:19.079><c> and</c>

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
is you might have the Swift system and
 

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.889 align:start position:0%
is you might have the Swift system and
the<00:11:19.860><c> U.S</c><00:11:20.220><c> based</c><00:11:20.700><c> Financial</c><00:11:20.880><c> system</c><00:11:21.360><c> that's</c>

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
the U.S based Financial system that's
 

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:24.050 align:start position:0%
the U.S based Financial system that's
that's<00:11:22.140><c> one</c><00:11:22.440><c> thing</c><00:11:22.620><c> but</c><00:11:23.279><c> on</c><00:11:23.399><c> the</c><00:11:23.579><c> other</c><00:11:23.760><c> end</c>

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but on the other end
 

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.290 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but on the other end
you<00:11:24.779><c> might</c><00:11:24.899><c> have</c><00:11:25.260><c> another</c><00:11:25.680><c> system</c><00:11:26.100><c> that</c><00:11:26.940><c> runs</c>

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
you might have another system that runs
 

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.449 align:start position:0%
you might have another system that runs
entirely<00:11:27.839><c> independent</c><00:11:28.500><c> instead</c><00:11:28.980><c> of</c><00:11:29.100><c> we</c><00:11:29.279><c> all</c>

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
entirely independent instead of we all
 

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.130 align:start position:0%
entirely independent instead of we all
use<00:11:29.760><c> the</c><00:11:30.000><c> Swift</c><00:11:30.120><c> system</c><00:11:30.480><c> we</c><00:11:30.720><c> all</c><00:11:30.839><c> use</c><00:11:31.019><c> the</c>

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
use the Swift system we all use the
 

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.170 align:start position:0%
use the Swift system we all use the
us-based<00:11:31.740><c> system</c><00:11:31.860><c> so</c><00:11:32.640><c> we're</c><00:11:32.760><c> going</c><00:11:33.000><c> to</c><00:11:33.060><c> have</c>

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
us-based system so we're going to have
 

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.150 align:start position:0%
us-based system so we're going to have
these<00:11:33.540><c> two</c><00:11:33.839><c> separate</c><00:11:34.260><c> systems</c><00:11:34.560><c> maybe</c><00:11:34.800><c> three</c>

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
these two separate systems maybe three
 

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.329 align:start position:0%
these two separate systems maybe three
or<00:11:35.399><c> four</c><00:11:35.640><c> separate</c><00:11:36.000><c> system</c><00:11:36.500><c> and</c><00:11:37.500><c> that</c><00:11:37.920><c> means</c>

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
or four separate system and that means
 

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:42.769 align:start position:0%
or four separate system and that means
ultimately<00:11:39.440><c> that</c><00:11:40.579><c> one</c><00:11:41.579><c> country</c><00:11:41.820><c> could</c><00:11:42.420><c> do</c>

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
ultimately that one country could do
 

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:45.170 align:start position:0%
ultimately that one country could do
business<00:11:43.019><c> in</c><00:11:43.440><c> these</c><00:11:43.680><c> other</c><00:11:43.800><c> systems</c><00:11:44.399><c> and</c><00:11:44.880><c> that</c>

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
business in these other systems and that
 

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.069 align:start position:0%
business in these other systems and that
would

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
would
 

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:49.069 align:start position:0%
would
suddenly<00:11:46.920><c> change</c><00:11:47.279><c> things</c><00:11:47.519><c> a</c><00:11:48.060><c> lot</c><00:11:48.180><c> it</c><00:11:48.600><c> really</c>

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
suddenly change things a lot it really
 

00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:51.250 align:start position:0%
suddenly change things a lot it really
doesn't<00:11:49.440><c> give</c><00:11:49.740><c> the</c><00:11:49.980><c> US</c><00:11:50.160><c> a</c><00:11:50.459><c> monopoly</c><00:11:51.000><c> anymore</c>

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:51.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't give the US a monopoly anymore
 

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.650 align:start position:0%
doesn't give the US a monopoly anymore
and<00:11:52.260><c> I</c><00:11:53.040><c> think</c><00:11:53.160><c> that</c><00:11:53.579><c> will</c><00:11:53.760><c> kind</c><00:11:54.000><c> of</c><00:11:54.120><c> Swing</c><00:11:54.480><c> the</c>

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
and I think that will kind of Swing the
 

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.009 align:start position:0%
and I think that will kind of Swing the

00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
that and understand that you know if

that and understand that you know if

these inflationary pressures aren't
 

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.690 align:start position:0%

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.490 align:start position:0%

that's<00:12:09.420><c> going</c><00:12:09.600><c> to</c><00:12:09.720><c> hurt</c><00:12:09.779><c> these</c><00:12:10.079><c> developing</c>

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to hurt these developing

that's going to hurt these developing

they've<00:12:13.920><c> got</c><00:12:14.100><c> to</c><00:12:14.339><c> change</c><00:12:14.640><c> it's</c><00:12:15.420><c> not</c><00:12:15.660><c> like</c><00:12:15.779><c> you</c>

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
