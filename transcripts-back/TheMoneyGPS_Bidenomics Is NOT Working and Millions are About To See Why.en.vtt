they're doing something else that's even
 

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.990 align:start position:0%
they're doing something else that's even
better<00:11:51.680><c> than</c><00:11:51.880><c> that</c><00:11:52.760><c> apparently</c><00:11:53.200><c> it's</c><00:11:53.519><c> the</c>

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
better than that apparently it's the
 

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.470 align:start position:0%
better than that apparently it's the

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
adhesive that they uses is actually
 

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.269 align:start position:0%
adhesive that they uses is actually
better<00:11:56.480><c> and</c><00:11:56.600><c> so</c><00:11:56.839><c> for</c><00:11:57.040><c> a</c><00:11:57.160><c> lot</c><00:11:57.279><c> of</c><00:11:57.480><c> people</c><00:11:58.120><c> I</c>

00:11:58.269 --> 00:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
better and so for a lot of people I
 

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:00.190 align:start position:0%
