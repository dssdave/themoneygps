favorable year-over-year effect you got
to<00:03:12.120><c> remember</c><00:03:12.239><c> this</c><00:03:12.540><c> when</c><00:03:12.840><c> we're</c><00:03:13.019><c> talking</c>

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
to remember this when we're talking
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.490 align:start position:0%
to remember this when we're talking
about<00:03:13.500><c> inflation</c><00:03:14.220><c> it</c><00:03:14.940><c> is</c><00:03:15.120><c> a</c><00:03:15.500><c> year-over-year</c>

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
about inflation it is a year-over-year
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.330 align:start position:0%
about inflation it is a year-over-year
statistic<00:03:17.280><c> so</c><00:03:18.239><c> of</c><00:03:18.720><c> course</c><00:03:18.900><c> on</c><00:03:19.379><c> the</c><00:03:19.500><c> way</c><00:03:19.680><c> up</c><00:03:19.920><c> it</c>

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
statistic so of course on the way up it
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.449 align:start position:0%
statistic so of course on the way up it
looks<00:03:20.700><c> extreme</c><00:03:21.180><c> because</c><00:03:21.959><c> inflation</c><00:03:22.920><c> was</c><00:03:23.220><c> in</c>

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 align:start position:0%
looks extreme because inflation was in
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.809 align:start position:0%
looks extreme because inflation was in
the<00:03:23.580><c> negative</c><00:03:24.000><c> inflation</c><00:03:24.840><c> was</c><00:03:25.200><c> down</c><00:03:25.700><c> and</c><00:03:26.700><c> then</c>

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
the negative inflation was down and then
 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.490 align:start position:0%
the negative inflation was down and then
year<00:03:27.060><c> over</c><00:03:27.239><c> year</c><00:03:27.480><c> you</c><00:03:27.720><c> start</c><00:03:27.900><c> adding</c><00:03:28.260><c> that</c><00:03:28.319><c> up</c>

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
year over year you start adding that up
 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.890 align:start position:0%
year over year you start adding that up
but<00:03:28.739><c> at</c><00:03:29.040><c> a</c><00:03:29.159><c> certain</c><00:03:29.280><c> point</c><00:03:29.760><c> it</c><00:03:30.480><c> starts</c><00:03:30.720><c> going</c>

we<00:03:55.860><c> got</c><00:03:55.980><c> to</c><00:03:56.159><c> do</c><00:03:56.280><c> this</c><00:03:56.459><c> month</c><00:03:56.819><c> over</c><00:03:57.060><c> month</c><00:03:57.420><c> so</c>

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
we got to do this month over month so
 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.250 align:start position:0%
we got to do this month over month so

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
over month basis we could start seeing
