think that if it's too high then it
 

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.430 align:start position:0%
think that if it's too high then it

induces the recession immediately and so
 

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.769 align:start position:0%

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.490 align:start position:0%
and so they're going a different route
but<00:11:57.240><c> the</c><00:11:57.420><c> world</c><00:11:57.540><c> is</c><00:11:57.720><c> still</c><00:11:57.899><c> dominated</c><00:11:58.260><c> by</c>

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
but the world is still dominated by
 

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.650 align:start position:0%
but the world is still dominated by

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
things like coal and so we'll see that
 

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.250 align:start position:0%
things like coal and so we'll see that
change<00:12:00.899><c> over</c><00:12:01.140><c> time</c><00:12:01.380><c> for</c><00:12:01.680><c> sure</c><00:12:01.860><c> and</c><00:12:02.760><c> even</c><00:12:03.000><c> if</c><00:12:03.600><c> it</c>

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
change over time for sure and even if it
 

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.069 align:start position:0%

brings<00:12:04.500><c> us</c><00:12:04.740><c> into</c><00:12:05.300><c> more</c><00:12:06.300><c> difficult</c><00:12:06.600><c> times</c><00:12:06.839><c> like</c>

00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
brings us into more difficult times like
 

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:09.410 align:start position:0%
brings us into more difficult times like
