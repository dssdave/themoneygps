00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
at you know um the positioning in total
 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
at you know um the positioning in total
like<00:06:05.280><c> how</c><00:06:05.440><c> many</c><00:06:05.759><c> stocks</c><00:06:06.039><c> are</c><00:06:06.400><c> actually</c><00:06:06.800><c> doing</c>

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
like how many stocks are actually doing
 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.830 align:start position:0%
like how many stocks are actually doing
well<00:06:07.759><c> and</c><00:06:07.880><c> it's</c><00:06:08.000><c> saying</c><00:06:08.199><c> we're</c><00:06:08.360><c> in</c><00:06:08.479><c> the</c><00:06:08.720><c> 85th</c>

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
well and it's saying we're in the 85th
 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
well and it's saying we're in the 85th
percentile<00:06:10.840><c> so</c><00:06:11.000><c> 85th</c><00:06:11.520><c> percentile</c><00:06:12.000><c> meaning</c>

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
percentile so 85th percentile meaning
 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.070 align:start position:0%
percentile so 85th percentile meaning
you<00:06:12.840><c> know</c><00:06:13.720><c> generally</c><00:06:14.720><c> we</c><00:06:14.840><c> don't</c><00:06:15.080><c> get</c><00:06:15.560><c> this</c>

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know generally we don't get this
 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.270 align:start position:0%
you know generally we don't get this

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
level of breadth and hopefully the idea
 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
level of breadth and hopefully the idea
here<00:06:20.639><c> is</c><00:06:20.880><c> that</c><00:06:21.280><c> other</c><00:06:21.759><c> stocks</c><00:06:22.599><c> start</c><00:06:22.919><c> to</c><00:06:23.160><c> come</c>

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
here is that other stocks start to come
 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.070 align:start position:0%
here is that other stocks start to come

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
up not that the high flying stocks come
 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.110 align:start position:0%
up not that the high flying stocks come
down<00:06:27.639><c> that's</c><00:06:27.800><c> what</c><00:06:27.919><c> they're</c><00:06:28.120><c> hoping</c><00:06:28.440><c> for</c>

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
down that's what they're hoping for
 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.150 align:start position:0%

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
money supply I think to myself this has
 

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.949 align:start position:0%
money supply I think to myself this has
to<00:08:46.040><c> move</c><00:08:46.279><c> up</c><00:08:46.959><c> in</c><00:08:47.320><c> relation</c><00:08:48.320><c> to</c><00:08:49.040><c> the</c><00:08:49.320><c> the</c><00:08:49.560><c> total</c>

00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
to move up in relation to the the total
 

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.949 align:start position:0%
to move up in relation to the the total
economic<00:08:50.399><c> growth</c><00:08:50.680><c> so</c><00:08:50.839><c> like</c><00:08:51.000><c> GDP</c><00:08:51.480><c> numbers</c>

00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
economic growth so like GDP numbers
 

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:55.310 align:start position:0%
economic growth so like GDP numbers
right<00:08:52.760><c> they</c><00:08:53.080><c> both</c><00:08:53.560><c> have</c><00:08:53.680><c> to</c><00:08:53.839><c> move</c><00:08:54.080><c> up</c><00:08:54.440><c> together</c>

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
right they both have to move up together
 

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.750 align:start position:0%
right they both have to move up together
and<00:08:55.480><c> if</c><00:08:55.640><c> they</c><00:08:55.880><c> don't</c><00:08:56.839><c> that</c><00:08:57.080><c> generally</c><00:08:58.079><c> insists</c>

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
and if they don't that generally insists
 

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.590 align:start position:0%
and if they don't that generally insists
that<00:08:58.920><c> there's</c><00:08:59.440><c> something</c><00:08:59.839><c> of</c><00:08:59.959><c> a</c><00:09:00.120><c> mismatch</c>

that there's something of a mismatch
there's<00:09:00.760><c> a</c><00:09:01.040><c> problem</c><00:09:01.560><c> and</c><00:09:01.760><c> then</c><00:09:02.399><c> it</c><00:09:02.560><c> let's</c><00:09:02.760><c> just</c>

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and then it let's just
 

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.509 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and then it let's just
say<00:09:03.079><c> it</c><00:09:03.279><c> fixes</c>

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
say it fixes
 

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:08.310 align:start position:0%
say it fixes

to be growing at this time if you're
 

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:23.230 align:start position:0%
to be growing at this time if you're
going<00:09:20.959><c> to</c><00:09:21.079><c> have</c><00:09:21.240><c> money</c><00:09:21.519><c> growth</c><00:09:22.240><c> and</c><00:09:22.560><c> and</c><00:09:22.959><c> uh</c><00:09:23.160><c> of</c>

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
going to have money growth and and uh of
 

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
going to have money growth and and uh of
course<00:09:23.399><c> they</c><00:09:23.480><c> work</c><00:09:23.720><c> hand</c><00:09:23.880><c> inand</c><00:09:24.880><c> and</c><00:09:24.959><c> so</c><00:09:25.120><c> we're</c>

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
course they work hand inand and so we're
 

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.069 align:start position:0%
course they work hand inand and so we're
seeing<00:09:25.640><c> that</c><00:09:25.920><c> right</c>

00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
seeing that right
 

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:30.269 align:start position:0%
seeing that right
now<00:09:28.079><c> I'm</c><00:09:28.480><c> concerned</c><00:09:29.240><c> about</c><00:09:29.519><c> what's</c><00:09:29.760><c> happening</c>

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
now I'm concerned about what's happening
 

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:34.230 align:start position:0%
now I'm concerned about what's happening
here<00:09:31.079><c> um</c><00:09:32.040><c> because</c><00:09:33.040><c> they</c><00:09:33.279><c> haven't</c><00:09:33.640><c> even</c><00:09:33.920><c> really</c>

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
here um because they haven't even really
 

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.990 align:start position:0%
here um because they haven't even really

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
stepped on the gas at all so the level
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.590 align:start position:0%
stepped on the gas at all so the level
of<00:09:37.600><c> inflation</c><00:09:38.600><c> that</c><00:09:38.839><c> we</c><00:09:39.040><c> are</c><00:09:39.240><c> dealing</c><00:09:40.200><c> with</c><00:09:41.200><c> um</c>

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
of inflation that we are dealing with um
 

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.150 align:start position:0%
of inflation that we are dealing with um
I<00:09:41.720><c> would</c><00:09:42.040><c> say</c><00:09:42.680><c> that</c><00:09:43.440><c> for</c><00:09:43.680><c> the</c><00:09:44.200><c> most</c><00:09:44.519><c> part</c><00:09:44.839><c> it's</c>

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
I would say that for the most part it's
 

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.829 align:start position:0%
I would say that for the most part it's
going<00:09:45.320><c> to</c><00:09:45.440><c> be</c><00:09:45.800><c> very</c>

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
