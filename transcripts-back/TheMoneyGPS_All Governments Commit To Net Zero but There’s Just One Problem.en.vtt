in this region over here when
 

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
in this region over here when
Commodities<00:12:16.399><c> were</c><00:12:16.600><c> going</c><00:12:16.880><c> up</c><00:12:17.079><c> I</c><00:12:17.160><c> started</c>

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
Commodities were going up I started
 

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.470 align:start position:0%
Commodities were going up I started
talking<00:12:17.639><c> about</c><00:12:17.880><c> uranium</c><00:12:18.880><c> and</c><00:12:19.000><c> you</c><00:12:19.079><c> could</c><00:12:19.240><c> see</c>

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
talking about uranium and you could see
 

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.189 align:start position:0%
talking about uranium and you could see
where<00:12:19.639><c> it</c><00:12:19.800><c> has</c><00:12:19.959><c> gone</c><00:12:20.199><c> from</c><00:12:20.480><c> then</c><00:12:20.720><c> so</c><00:12:20.839><c> let's</c><00:12:21.000><c> say</c>

00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
where it has gone from then so let's say
 

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.389 align:start position:0%
where it has gone from then so let's say
about<00:12:21.480><c> you</c><00:12:21.600><c> know</c>

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
about you know
 

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:25.150 align:start position:0%
about you know
1315<00:12:23.399><c> right</c><00:12:23.519><c> now</c><00:12:23.639><c> it's</c><00:12:23.760><c> at</c><00:12:23.839><c> $52</c><00:12:24.760><c> this</c><00:12:24.920><c> happens</c>

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
1315 right now it's at $52 this happens
 

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.350 align:start position:0%
1315 right now it's at $52 this happens
to<00:12:25.240><c> be</c><00:12:25.399><c> chemico</c><00:12:25.880><c> is</c><00:12:26.079><c> just</c><00:12:26.240><c> the</c><00:12:26.800><c> biggest</c><00:12:27.800><c> um</c><00:12:28.199><c> in</c>

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
to be chemico is just the biggest um in
 

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.189 align:start position:0%
to be chemico is just the biggest um in
the<00:12:28.440><c> uranium</c><00:12:29.040><c> space</c><00:12:30.000><c> but</c><00:12:30.199><c> not</c><00:12:30.440><c> just</c><00:12:30.760><c> that</c><00:12:31.160><c> I</c>

00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
the uranium space but not just that I
 

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
the uranium space but not just that I
mean<00:12:31.399><c> I</c><00:12:31.519><c> said</c><00:12:31.800><c> uranium</c><00:12:32.399><c> in</c><00:12:32.560><c> general</c><00:12:32.959><c> look</c><00:12:33.160><c> at</c>

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
mean I said uranium in general look at
 

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.069 align:start position:0%
mean I said uranium in general look at
chemico<00:12:33.800><c> of</c><00:12:33.920><c> course</c><00:12:34.199><c> just</c><00:12:34.399><c> because</c><00:12:34.639><c> it's</c><00:12:34.839><c> the</c>

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
chemico of course just because it's the
 

00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:39.310 align:start position:0%
chemico of course just because it's the
biggest<00:12:36.079><c> um</c><00:12:36.680><c> but</c><00:12:37.079><c> that's</c><00:12:37.560><c> what</c><00:12:38.040><c> happens</c><00:12:39.000><c> now</c>

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
biggest um but that's what happens now
 

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.710 align:start position:0%
biggest um but that's what happens now
from<00:12:39.680><c> here</c><00:12:39.880><c> on</c><00:12:40.440><c> of</c><00:12:40.600><c> course</c><00:12:41.160><c> when</c><00:12:41.320><c> you</c><00:12:41.440><c> have</c><00:12:41.560><c> a</c>

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
from here on of course when you have a
 

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.030 align:start position:0%
from here on of course when you have a
runup<00:12:42.279><c> it's</c><00:12:42.720><c> difficult</c><00:12:42.880><c> to</c><00:12:43.040><c> say</c><00:12:43.440><c> okay</c><00:12:43.760><c> well</c>

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
runup it's difficult to say okay well
 

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.110 align:start position:0%
runup it's difficult to say okay well
you<00:12:44.160><c> know</c><00:12:44.519><c> this</c><00:12:45.040><c> going</c><00:12:45.160><c> to</c><00:12:45.279><c> go</c><00:12:45.360><c> out</c><00:12:45.560><c> forever</c>

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
you know this going to go out forever
 

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.069 align:start position:0%
you know this going to go out forever
usually<00:12:46.480><c> not</c><00:12:46.720><c> the</c><00:12:46.880><c> case</c><00:12:47.639><c> but</c><00:12:48.240><c> when</c><00:12:48.399><c> we</c><00:12:48.600><c> compare</c>

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
usually not the case but when we compare
 

00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:51.430 align:start position:0%
usually not the case but when we compare
this<00:12:49.279><c> to</c><00:12:49.480><c> the</c><00:12:49.760><c> other</c><00:12:50.120><c> miners</c><00:12:50.839><c> other</c><00:12:51.120><c> metal</c>

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
this to the other miners other metal
 

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.829 align:start position:0%
this to the other miners other metal

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.870 align:start position:0%
Miners and things um actually uranium U
might<00:12:56.120><c> not</c><00:12:56.440><c> be</c><00:12:57.199><c> a</c><00:12:57.360><c> bad</c><00:12:57.600><c> pick</c><00:12:57.880><c> there's</c><00:12:58.519><c> other</c>

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
might not be a bad pick there's other
 

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.230 align:start position:0%
might not be a bad pick there's other
things<00:12:59.040><c> to</c><00:12:59.160><c> think</c><00:12:59.360><c> about</c><00:12:59.600><c> in</c><00:12:59.760><c> that</c><00:12:59.880><c> it's</c><00:13:00.000><c> not</c>

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
things to think about in that it's not
 

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.670 align:start position:0%
things to think about in that it's not
just<00:13:01.000><c> one</c><00:13:01.320><c> aspect</c><00:13:01.680><c> anyway</c><00:13:02.000><c> but</c><00:13:02.120><c> the</c><00:13:02.240><c> point</c><00:13:02.519><c> is</c>

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
just one aspect anyway but the point is
 

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.629 align:start position:0%
just one aspect anyway but the point is
you've<00:13:02.959><c> got</c><00:13:03.680><c> the</c><00:13:04.320><c> ways</c><00:13:04.720><c> to</c><00:13:05.040><c> play</c><00:13:05.320><c> it</c><00:13:06.160><c> and</c><00:13:06.320><c> so</c>

00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
you've got the ways to play it and so
 

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:11.069 align:start position:0%
you've got the ways to play it and so
you<00:13:06.839><c> can</c><00:13:07.040><c> see</c><00:13:07.680><c> that</c><00:13:08.680><c> uh</c><00:13:09.000><c> with</c><00:13:09.680><c> this</c><00:13:10.360><c> physical</c>

00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
you can see that uh with this physical
 

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:13.629 align:start position:0%
you can see that uh with this physical
Sprout<00:13:11.800><c> uranium</c><00:13:12.600><c> where</c><00:13:12.800><c> they're</c><00:13:13.120><c> actually</c>

00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
Sprout uranium where they're actually
 

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:17.150 align:start position:0%
Sprout uranium where they're actually
buying<00:13:14.079><c> the</c><00:13:14.279><c> uranium</c><00:13:15.160><c> itself</c><00:13:16.160><c> or</c><00:13:16.560><c> you</c><00:13:16.680><c> can</c><00:13:16.880><c> get</c>

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
buying the uranium itself or you can get
 

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.069 align:start position:0%
buying the uranium itself or you can get
the<00:13:17.320><c> you</c><00:13:17.399><c> know</c><00:13:17.680><c> companies</c><00:13:18.240><c> that</c><00:13:18.320><c> are</c><00:13:18.680><c> involved</c>

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
the you know companies that are involved
 

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:22.870 align:start position:0%
the you know companies that are involved
in<00:13:19.199><c> it</c><00:13:19.839><c> and</c><00:13:20.000><c> so</c><00:13:20.800><c> the</c><00:13:21.600><c> physical</c><00:13:22.320><c> operates</c><00:13:22.760><c> a</c>

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
in it and so the physical operates a
 

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.790 align:start position:0%
in it and so the physical operates a
little<00:13:23.040><c> bit</c><00:13:23.240><c> differently</c><00:13:23.720><c> obviously</c><00:13:24.360><c> but</c><00:13:24.680><c> you</c>

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
little bit differently obviously but you
 

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.670 align:start position:0%
little bit differently obviously but you
can<00:13:24.959><c> see</c><00:13:25.600><c> performance</c><00:13:26.160><c> has</c><00:13:26.360><c> been</c><00:13:27.199><c> very</c><00:13:27.440><c> nice</c>

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
can see performance has been very nice
 

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.110 align:start position:0%
can see performance has been very nice
as<00:13:27.800><c> well</c><00:13:28.360><c> and</c><00:13:28.440><c> so</c><00:13:28.600><c> the</c><00:13:28.880><c> Point</c><00:13:29.120><c> here</c><00:13:29.360><c> is</c><00:13:29.760><c> I</c><00:13:29.880><c> was</c>

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
as well and so the Point here is I was
 

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.509 align:start position:0%
as well and so the Point here is I was
talking<00:13:30.480><c> to</c><00:13:30.720><c> you</c><00:13:30.959><c> about</c><00:13:31.199><c> that</c><00:13:31.480><c> years</c><00:13:31.760><c> ago</c><00:13:32.199><c> not</c>

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
talking to you about that years ago not
 

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.470 align:start position:0%
talking to you about that years ago not

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.910 align:start position:0%
because of some sort of crystal ball

me no crystal ball it's not here what we
 

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.790 align:start position:0%
me no crystal ball it's not here what we
do<00:13:40.079><c> is</c><00:13:40.199><c> we</c><00:13:40.320><c> look</c><00:13:40.440><c> at</c><00:13:40.519><c> the</c><00:13:40.639><c> fundamentals</c><00:13:41.360><c> and</c><00:13:41.639><c> I</c>

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
do is we look at the fundamentals and I
 

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.069 align:start position:0%
do is we look at the fundamentals and I
break<00:13:42.160><c> these</c><00:13:42.440><c> things</c><00:13:42.800><c> down</c><00:13:43.519><c> anybody</c><00:13:44.160><c> who</c><00:13:44.480><c> has</c>
