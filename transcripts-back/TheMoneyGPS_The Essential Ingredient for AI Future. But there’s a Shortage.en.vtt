00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
so there's a problem there okay so the
 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.950 align:start position:0%
so there's a problem there okay so the

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 align:start position:0%
about that they have to start getting on
 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.749 align:start position:0%
