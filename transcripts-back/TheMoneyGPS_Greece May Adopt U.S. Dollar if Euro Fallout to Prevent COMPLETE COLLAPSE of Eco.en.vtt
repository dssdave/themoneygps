00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
like Panama for example
 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.749 align:start position:0%

so this is something that shows you that
 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
so this is something that shows you that

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be necessarily owned

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.990 align:start position:0%

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
another country they can adopt that if
 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.870 align:start position:0%
another country they can adopt that if

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for them they can adopt
 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.589 align:start position:0%

this is uh you know a test put it out in
 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.629 align:start position:0%
this is uh you know a test put it out in
the<00:06:28.599><c> media</c><00:06:28.919><c> see</c><00:06:29.080><c> how</c><00:06:29.199><c> people</c><00:06:29.599><c> react</c><00:06:29.880><c> to</c><00:06:30.000><c> it</c><00:06:30.479><c> and</c>
