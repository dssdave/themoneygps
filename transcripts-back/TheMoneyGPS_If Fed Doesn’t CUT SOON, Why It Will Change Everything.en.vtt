absolutely raise their Target because

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 align:start position:0%

they could very well do or as I've said
before<00:04:06.840><c> maybe</c><00:04:07.200><c> create</c><00:04:07.640><c> like</c><00:04:07.760><c> a</c><00:04:07.879><c> window</c>

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
they'll say between 2% and 3% instead of
