normal swing so if every day it's moving
by<00:01:18.759><c> let's</c><00:01:18.960><c> say</c><00:01:19.159><c> half</c><00:01:19.320><c> a</c><00:01:19.520><c> percent</c><00:01:19.880><c> or</c><00:01:20.079><c> a</c><00:01:20.240><c> percent</c>

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
by let's say half a percent or a percent
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.550 align:start position:0%
by let's say half a percent or a percent
and<00:01:21.240><c> this</c><00:01:21.439><c> time</c><00:01:22.000><c> it</c><00:01:22.119><c> would</c><00:01:22.280><c> be</c><00:01:22.479><c> triple</c><00:01:22.960><c> that</c>

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
and this time it would be triple that
