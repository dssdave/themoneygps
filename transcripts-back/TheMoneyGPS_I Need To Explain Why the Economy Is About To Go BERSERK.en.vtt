you know you try to do deficit spending
and<00:05:10.199><c> guess</c><00:05:10.380><c> what</c><00:05:10.620><c> long</c><00:05:11.040><c> term</c><00:05:11.280><c> we've</c><00:05:11.880><c> seen</c><00:05:12.120><c> this</c>

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
and guess what long term we've seen this
 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.810 align:start position:0%
and guess what long term we've seen this
before<00:05:12.600><c> for</c><00:05:13.320><c> every</c><00:05:13.680><c> dollar</c><00:05:13.979><c> that</c><00:05:14.460><c> goes</c><00:05:14.699><c> into</c>

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
before for every dollar that goes into
 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.090 align:start position:0%
before for every dollar that goes into
the<00:05:15.120><c> economy</c><00:05:15.540><c> you</c><00:05:15.780><c> get</c><00:05:15.960><c> less</c><00:05:16.259><c> out</c>

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
the economy you get less out
 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.270 align:start position:0%
the economy you get less out
so<00:05:17.699><c> it's</c><00:05:17.940><c> like</c><00:05:18.240><c> a</c><00:05:18.780><c> drug</c><00:05:18.900><c> addict</c><00:05:19.320><c> that</c><00:05:20.040><c> yeah</c>

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
so it's like a drug addict that yeah
 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
so it's like a drug addict that yeah
they<00:05:20.759><c> need</c><00:05:21.060><c> more</c><00:05:21.600><c> and</c><00:05:21.840><c> more</c><00:05:22.199><c> and</c><00:05:22.440><c> more</c><00:05:22.740><c> or</c><00:05:23.100><c> an</c>
