expected return of 10% annually so
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.429 align:start position:0%
expected return of 10% annually so
that's<00:01:03.559><c> the</c><00:01:03.719><c> case</c><00:01:04.159><c> the</c><00:01:04.400><c> market</c><00:01:04.799><c> would</c><00:01:05.080><c> have</c><00:01:05.199><c> to</c>

that's the case the market would have to
 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.310 align:start position:0%
that's the case the market would have to

a depression and so on just to get back

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.710 align:start position:0%
to reality and so we've really come off
course<00:01:26.400><c> there's</c><00:01:26.600><c> no</c><00:01:26.840><c> question</c><00:01:27.119><c> about</c><00:01:27.400><c> that</c><00:01:27.600><c> I</c>

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 align:start position:0%

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.830 align:start position:0%
course there's no question about that I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't deny this but would they even
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.109 align:start position:0%
don't deny this but would they even
allow<00:01:31.600><c> this</c><00:01:31.920><c> to</c><00:01:32.280><c> occur</c><00:01:33.280><c> that's</c><00:01:33.640><c> really</c><00:01:33.920><c> the</c>

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
allow this to occur that's really the
 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.429 align:start position:0%
allow this to occur that's really the
difference<00:01:34.680><c> because</c><00:01:35.680><c> just</c><00:01:35.920><c> like</c><00:01:36.119><c> in</c><00:01:36.439><c> Japan</c>
