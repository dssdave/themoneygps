00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.710 align:start position:0%
which is basically the way that we look

Consumer Price Index or CPI and so you
 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.830 align:start position:0%

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
realize here is that if it's surging

realize here is that if it's surging
well<00:05:41.880><c> that</c><00:05:42.039><c> means</c><00:05:42.479><c> they</c><00:05:42.600><c> can't</c><00:05:42.840><c> cut</c><00:05:43.120><c> interest</c>

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
