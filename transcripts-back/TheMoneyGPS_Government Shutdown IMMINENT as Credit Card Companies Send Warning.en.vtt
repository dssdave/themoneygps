this wouldn't be the first time but
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.969 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be the first time but

I<00:07:32.699><c> mean</c><00:07:32.880><c> but</c><00:07:33.060><c> that's</c><00:07:33.240><c> the</c><00:07:33.419><c> way</c><00:07:33.539><c> it</c><00:07:33.660><c> is</c><00:07:33.840><c> right</c>

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
I mean but that's the way it is right
 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.670 align:start position:0%
I mean but that's the way it is right
look<00:07:35.460><c> you</c><00:07:36.060><c> might</c><00:07:36.180><c> ask</c><00:07:36.360><c> yourself</c><00:07:36.539><c> what's</c><00:07:37.440><c> next</c>

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.029 align:start position:0%
what's coming
well<00:07:39.660><c> let</c><00:07:39.780><c> me</c><00:07:39.900><c> just</c><00:07:40.080><c> talk</c><00:07:40.440><c> about</c><00:07:40.620><c> the</c><00:07:40.919><c> fact</c>

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
well let me just talk about the fact
 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.550 align:start position:0%
well let me just talk about the fact
that<00:07:41.220><c> the</c><00:07:42.180><c> debt</c><00:07:42.599><c> is</c><00:07:42.720><c> up</c>

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
that the debt is up
 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.129 align:start position:0%
that the debt is up
certainly

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:45.139 align:start position:0%
certainly
 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:48.469 align:start position:0%
certainly
I<00:07:46.139><c> mean</c><00:07:46.259><c> just</c><00:07:46.740><c> look</c><00:07:46.860><c> at</c><00:07:47.039><c> that</c><00:07:47.099><c> blue</c><00:07:47.340><c> line</c><00:07:47.580><c> and</c>

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
I mean just look at that blue line and
 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.390 align:start position:0%
I mean just look at that blue line and
then<00:07:48.599><c> you</c><00:07:48.660><c> compare</c><00:07:48.900><c> that</c><00:07:49.020><c> with</c><00:07:49.199><c> the</c><00:07:49.319><c> GDP</c><00:07:49.740><c> now</c>

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
then you compare that with the GDP now
 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.629 align:start position:0%
then you compare that with the GDP now
even<00:07:50.639><c> by</c><00:07:51.000><c> using</c><00:07:51.479><c> their</c><00:07:51.660><c> metrics</c><00:07:52.199><c> of</c><00:07:52.500><c> GDP</c>

even by using their metrics of GDP
we<00:07:54.360><c> still</c><00:07:54.539><c> see</c><00:07:54.780><c> this</c><00:07:55.080><c> great</c><00:07:55.319><c> disconnect</c><00:07:55.620><c> in</c>

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
we still see this great disconnect in
 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.390 align:start position:0%
