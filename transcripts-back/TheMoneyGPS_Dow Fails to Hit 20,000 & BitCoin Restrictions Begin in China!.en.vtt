biggest names I mean that's just the way
it<00:02:35.800><c> works</c><00:02:36.400><c> so</c><00:02:36.599><c> they</c><00:02:37.000><c> all</c><00:02:38.000><c> are</c><00:02:38.400><c> buying</c><00:02:38.840><c> up</c>

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
it works so they all are buying up
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.270 align:start position:0%
it works so they all are buying up
these<00:02:41.040><c> stocks</c><00:02:42.040><c> and</c><00:02:42.519><c> choosing</c><00:02:42.879><c> particular</c>
