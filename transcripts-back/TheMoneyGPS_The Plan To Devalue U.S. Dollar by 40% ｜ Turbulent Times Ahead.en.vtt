00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
the currency of 40 and you know kind of
 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.550 align:start position:0%
the currency of 40 and you know kind of
suggests<00:03:25.680><c> that</c><00:03:26.459><c> they'll</c><00:03:27.239><c> do</c><00:03:27.720><c> anything</c><00:03:27.959><c> and</c>

suggests that they'll do anything and
 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.649 align:start position:0%
suggests that they'll do anything and
that's<00:03:28.800><c> the</c><00:03:29.040><c> example</c><00:03:29.459><c> that</c><00:03:29.700><c> he's</c><00:03:29.819><c> using</c><00:03:30.120><c> so</c><00:03:30.420><c> it</c>

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
that's the example that he's using so it
 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.869 align:start position:0%
that's the example that he's using so it
could<00:03:31.019><c> be</c><00:03:31.140><c> more</c><00:03:31.319><c> than</c><00:03:31.500><c> 40</c><00:03:31.739><c> percent</c>

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
could be more than 40 percent
 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.570 align:start position:0%
could be more than 40 percent
but<00:03:33.420><c> he's</c><00:03:33.659><c> saying</c><00:03:33.959><c> look</c><00:03:34.260><c> at</c><00:03:34.379><c> what</c><00:03:34.560><c> we</c><00:03:34.739><c> did</c><00:03:34.920><c> that</c>

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
but he's saying look at what we did that
 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.770 align:start position:0%
but he's saying look at what we did that
was<00:03:35.760><c> fantastic</c>

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
was fantastic
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.710 align:start position:0%
was fantastic
it<00:03:37.379><c> was</c><00:03:37.500><c> necessary</c><00:03:37.920><c> we</c><00:03:38.459><c> did</c><00:03:38.640><c> it</c><00:03:38.819><c> we</c><00:03:39.360><c> made</c><00:03:39.540><c> it</c>

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
it was necessary we did it we made it
 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.710 align:start position:0%
it was necessary we did it we made it
