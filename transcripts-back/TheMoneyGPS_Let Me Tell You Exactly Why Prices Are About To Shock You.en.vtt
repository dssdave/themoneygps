anyway<00:11:46.160><c> and</c><00:11:46.279><c> then</c><00:11:46.399><c> we</c><00:11:46.519><c> have</c><00:11:46.680><c> autos</c><00:11:47.200><c> and</c><00:11:47.480><c> trucks</c>

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.949 align:start position:0%
anyway and then we have autos and trucks
looking<00:11:48.760><c> at</c><00:11:49.000><c> the</c><00:11:49.160><c> demand</c><00:11:49.720><c> on</c><00:11:49.920><c> that</c><00:11:50.160><c> as</c><00:11:50.320><c> well</c>

00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
certainly less there okay so going back
 

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.670 align:start position:0%
