00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
themselves that is a fact so we know
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.150 align:start position:0%
themselves that is a fact so we know
that<00:02:19.239><c> when</c><00:02:19.400><c> the</c><00:02:19.519><c> market</c><00:02:19.840><c> says</c><00:02:20.319><c> this</c><00:02:20.480><c> is</c><00:02:20.760><c> likely</c>

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
that when the market says this is likely
 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
that when the market says this is likely
to<00:02:21.440><c> happen</c><00:02:22.360><c> it</c><00:02:22.720><c> probably</c><00:02:23.160><c> will</c><00:02:23.480><c> not</c><00:02:23.840><c> 100%</c><00:02:24.840><c> but</c>

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
to happen it probably will not 100% but
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.710 align:start position:0%
to happen it probably will not 100% but
probably<00:02:26.000><c> and</c><00:02:26.120><c> so</c><00:02:26.440><c> right</c><00:02:26.680><c> now</c><00:02:27.280><c> there's</c><00:02:27.519><c> a</c>

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
probably and so right now there's a
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.070 align:start position:0%
probably and so right now there's a
little<00:02:27.959><c> bit</c><00:02:28.120><c> of</c><00:02:28.239><c> a</c><00:02:28.400><c> change</c><00:02:28.959><c> and</c><00:02:29.120><c> we'll</c><00:02:29.879><c> show</c>

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of a change and we'll show
 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.070 align:start position:0%
little bit of a change and we'll show
you<00:02:30.360><c> why</c><00:02:31.080><c> so</c><00:02:31.360><c> this</c><00:02:31.599><c> just</c><00:02:31.840><c> tells</c><00:02:32.160><c> us</c><00:02:32.800><c> that</c><00:02:33.239><c> the</c>

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
you why so this just tells us that the
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.830 align:start position:0%
you why so this just tells us that the
expectation<00:02:34.800><c> of</c><00:02:35.000><c> rate</c><00:02:35.280><c> Cuts</c><00:02:35.920><c> is</c><00:02:36.080><c> soon</c><00:02:36.640><c> okay</c>

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 align:start position:0%

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.990 align:start position:0%

look<00:02:37.280><c> maybe</c><00:02:37.480><c> it's</c><00:02:37.599><c> not</c><00:02:37.800><c> March</c><00:02:38.360><c> maybe</c><00:02:38.640><c> it's</c><00:02:38.840><c> the</c>

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
look maybe it's not March maybe it's the
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.550 align:start position:0%
look maybe it's not March maybe it's the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.190 align:start position:0%
