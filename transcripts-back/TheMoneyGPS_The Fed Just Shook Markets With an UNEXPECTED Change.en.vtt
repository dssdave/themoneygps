00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
they would be cutting interest rates
 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.149 align:start position:0%
they would be cutting interest rates
this<00:03:28.480><c> year</c><00:03:29.000><c> assuming</c><00:03:30.040><c> the</c><00:03:30.239><c> data</c><00:03:30.599><c> continues</c>

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
the way it is I didn't say the data is
 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.270 align:start position:0%

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
getting better I said the data the way
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.070 align:start position:0%
getting better I said the data the way
it<00:03:35.480><c> is</c><00:03:35.799><c> now</c><00:03:36.640><c> this</c><00:03:36.760><c> is</c><00:03:37.080><c> going</c><00:03:37.239><c> to</c><00:03:37.439><c> cause</c><00:03:37.799><c> them</c><00:03:37.920><c> to</c>

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
it is now this is going to cause them to
 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.990 align:start position:0%
it is now this is going to cause them to
