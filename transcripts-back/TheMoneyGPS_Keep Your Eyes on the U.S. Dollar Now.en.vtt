but<00:03:21.000><c> this</c><00:03:21.360><c> works</c><00:03:21.780><c> in</c><00:03:22.080><c> the</c><00:03:22.260><c> opposite</c><00:03:22.560><c> direction</c>

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
but this works in the opposite direction
 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.430 align:start position:0%
but this works in the opposite direction
because<00:03:23.159><c> if</c><00:03:23.519><c> the</c><00:03:23.760><c> US</c><00:03:24.000><c> dollar</c><00:03:24.360><c> is</c><00:03:24.659><c> too</c><00:03:25.140><c> strong</c>

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
because if the US dollar is too strong
 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.830 align:start position:0%
because if the US dollar is too strong
then<00:03:26.280><c> you</c><00:03:26.519><c> have</c><00:03:26.640><c> a</c><00:03:26.879><c> country</c><00:03:27.000><c> like</c><00:03:27.420><c> for</c>
