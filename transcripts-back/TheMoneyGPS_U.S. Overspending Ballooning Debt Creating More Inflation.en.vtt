00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.990 align:start position:0%
biggest concern but ultimately what
we're<00:10:18.279><c> seeing</c><00:10:18.760><c> is</c><00:10:19.079><c> that</c><00:10:19.600><c> a</c><00:10:19.720><c> lot</c><00:10:19.880><c> of</c><00:10:20.040><c> the</c><00:10:20.240><c> debt</c>

that's where I think that we have the
 

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.910 align:start position:0%
that's where I think that we have the
