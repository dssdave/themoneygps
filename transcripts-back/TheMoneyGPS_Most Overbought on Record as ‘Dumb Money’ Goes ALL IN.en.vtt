00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
the S&amp;P 500 has never been higher so
 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.830 align:start position:0%
the S&amp;P 500 has never been higher so
this<00:06:37.479><c> is</c><00:06:37.599><c> the</c><00:06:37.759><c> percentage</c><00:06:38.160><c> of</c><00:06:38.319><c> stocks</c><00:06:38.680><c> with</c>

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
this is the percentage of stocks with
 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.309 align:start position:0%
this is the percentage of stocks with
that<00:06:39.039><c> RSI</c><00:06:40.039><c> as</c><00:06:40.199><c> a</c><00:06:40.400><c> relative</c><00:06:40.960><c> strength</c><00:06:41.599><c> index</c>

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
that RSI as a relative strength index
 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.710 align:start position:0%
that RSI as a relative strength index
greater<00:06:42.720><c> than</c><00:06:42.880><c> 70</c><00:06:43.759><c> reached</c><00:06:44.360><c> a</c><00:06:44.520><c> series</c><00:06:45.039><c> high</c><00:06:45.759><c> in</c>

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
greater than 70 reached a series high in
 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.189 align:start position:0%
greater than 70 reached a series high in
December<00:06:47.720><c> and</c><00:06:47.880><c> so</c><00:06:48.160><c> what</c><00:06:48.319><c> this</c><00:06:48.479><c> means</c><00:06:48.880><c> is</c>

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
December and so what this means is
 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.430 align:start position:0%
December and so what this means is
basically<00:06:49.960><c> it's</c><00:06:50.080><c> an</c><00:06:50.360><c> oscillator</c><00:06:51.120><c> okay</c><00:06:51.280><c> it</c>

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
basically it's an oscillator okay it
 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.629 align:start position:0%
basically it's an oscillator okay it

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
how overbought or oversold something is
 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.270 align:start position:0%
how overbought or oversold something is
and<00:07:04.440><c> there's</c><00:07:04.720><c> different</c><00:07:05.319><c> ways</c><00:07:05.599><c> to</c><00:07:05.759><c> look</c><00:07:05.960><c> at</c><00:07:06.160><c> or</c>

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
and there's different ways to look at or
 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.629 align:start position:0%
and there's different ways to look at or
whatever<00:07:06.599><c> but</c><00:07:06.879><c> the</c><00:07:06.960><c> way</c><00:07:07.080><c> they're</c><00:07:07.240><c> doing</c><00:07:07.479><c> it</c>

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
whatever but the way they're doing it
 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.029 align:start position:0%
whatever but the way they're doing it
here<00:07:07.840><c> is</c><00:07:08.039><c> basically</c><00:07:08.479><c> over</c><00:07:08.840><c> 70</c><00:07:09.680><c> means</c>

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
here is basically over 70 means
 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.589 align:start position:0%
here is basically over 70 means
overbought<00:07:11.039><c> all</c><00:07:11.280><c> right</c><00:07:12.280><c> and</c><00:07:12.400><c> so</c><00:07:12.639><c> there</c><00:07:12.759><c> it</c><00:07:12.879><c> is</c>

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
overbought all right and so there it is
 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.550 align:start position:0%
overbought all right and so there it is
never<00:07:13.800><c> seen</c><00:07:14.000><c> it</c><00:07:14.199><c> this</c><00:07:14.360><c> high</c><00:07:14.599><c> before</c><00:07:15.400><c> never</c><00:07:16.400><c> so</c>

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
never seen it this high before never so
 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.189 align:start position:0%
never seen it this high before never so
what<00:07:16.639><c> does</c><00:07:16.800><c> that</c><00:07:16.919><c> tell</c><00:07:17.080><c> you</c><00:07:17.319><c> it</c><00:07:17.440><c> means</c><00:07:17.919><c> that</c>

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
what does that tell you it means that
 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.950 align:start position:0%
what does that tell you it means that
stocks<00:07:18.560><c> are</c><00:07:18.960><c> generally</c><00:07:19.879><c> overbought</c><00:07:20.800><c> right</c>

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
stocks are generally overbought right
 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.710 align:start position:0%
stocks are generally overbought right
now<00:07:21.280><c> and</c><00:07:21.479><c> that</c><00:07:21.720><c> doesn't</c><00:07:22.000><c> mean</c><00:07:22.240><c> that</c><00:07:22.319><c> it</c><00:07:22.440><c> goes</c>

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
now and that doesn't mean that it goes
 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.749 align:start position:0%
now and that doesn't mean that it goes

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.110 align:start position:0%

tomorrow<00:07:24.759><c> that</c><00:07:24.960><c> means</c><00:07:25.800><c> that</c><00:07:25.960><c> it's</c><00:07:26.319><c> very</c>

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that means that it's very
 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.070 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that means that it's very

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to push higher and that means
 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.070 align:start position:0%
difficult to push higher and that means

down the probability increases the

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
that's all it is increasing
 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.710 align:start position:0%
that's all it is increasing

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.510 align:start position:0%

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.710 align:start position:0%

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
in that overbought territory it's not
