00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.650 align:start position:0%
 
what<00:00:58.530><c> we</c><00:00:58.680><c> had</c><00:00:58.920><c> was</c><00:00:59.340><c> a</c><00:00:59.730><c> time</c><00:01:00.890><c> in</c><00:01:01.890><c> which</c><00:01:02.660><c> fewer</c>

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
what we had was a time in which fewer
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 align:start position:0%
what we had was a time in which fewer

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
and fewer opportunities were available
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.550 align:start position:0%
and fewer opportunities were available
and<00:01:06.930><c> so</c><00:01:07.680><c> the</c><00:01:07.890><c> money</c><00:01:08.600><c> that</c><00:01:09.600><c> wanted</c><00:01:10.320><c> to</c><00:01:10.409><c> go</c>

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
and so the money that wanted to go
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820 align:start position:0%
and so the money that wanted to go
somewhere<00:01:11.030><c> ended</c><00:01:12.030><c> up</c><00:01:12.150><c> all</c><00:01:12.450><c> flowing</c><00:01:12.869><c> into</c><00:01:13.320><c> one</c>

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere ended up all flowing into one
thing<00:01:14.280><c> and</c><00:01:14.670><c> it</c><00:01:15.509><c> was</c><00:01:15.659><c> technology</c><00:01:16.159><c> that</c><00:01:17.159><c> was</c><00:01:17.340><c> the</c>

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 align:start position:0%
thing and it was technology that was the
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
thing and it was technology that was the

this<00:01:21.330><c> time</c><00:01:21.619><c> we</c><00:01:22.619><c> can</c><00:01:22.830><c> definitely</c><00:01:23.040><c> see</c><00:01:23.490><c> that</c><00:01:23.670><c> it</c>

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
this time we can definitely see that it
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.810 align:start position:0%
this time we can definitely see that it
is<00:01:24.090><c> receiving</c><00:01:24.570><c> a</c><00:01:24.990><c> lot</c><00:01:25.860><c> of</c><00:01:25.890><c> the</c><00:01:26.100><c> funding</c><00:01:26.549><c> that's</c>
