00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.149 align:start position:0%
one-year Bond well the 30-year you would

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
assume would give you a better rate of

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
return than the onee but when that
 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.110 align:start position:0%
return than the onee but when that
that's<00:03:00.040><c> flipped</c><00:03:01.000><c> that's</c><00:03:01.319><c> an</c><00:03:02.040><c> inversion</c><00:03:03.040><c> and</c>

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's flipped that's an inversion and
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.390 align:start position:0%
that's flipped that's an inversion and
so<00:03:03.280><c> that's</c><00:03:03.440><c> what's</c><00:03:03.599><c> happening</c><00:03:03.879><c> today</c><00:03:04.159><c> but</c><00:03:04.280><c> now</c>
