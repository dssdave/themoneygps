right now the US and Russia relationship
 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
right now the US and Russia relationship
obviously<00:00:45.090><c> there</c><00:00:45.329><c> is</c><00:00:45.480><c> major</c><00:00:46.079><c> tension</c><00:00:46.680><c> going</c>

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 align:start position:0%
obviously there is major tension going
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.930 align:start position:0%
obviously there is major tension going
on<00:00:47.070><c> because</c><00:00:47.309><c> of</c><00:00:47.579><c> what</c><00:00:47.820><c> has</c><00:00:47.969><c> happened</c><00:00:48.000><c> in</c><00:00:48.930><c> Syria</c>

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 align:start position:0%
on because of what has happened in Syria
 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.330 align:start position:0%
on because of what has happened in Syria
then<00:00:50.940><c> you</c><00:00:51.180><c> put</c><00:00:51.870><c> on</c><00:00:51.989><c> top</c><00:00:52.199><c> of</c><00:00:52.440><c> that</c><00:00:52.559><c> what's</c><00:00:52.980><c> going</c>

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
then you put on top of that what's going
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 align:start position:0%
then you put on top of that what's going
on<00:00:53.489><c> in</c><00:00:53.670><c> North</c><00:00:53.789><c> Korea</c><00:00:54.300><c> and</c><00:00:54.690><c> then</c><00:00:55.350><c> you</c><00:00:55.469><c> have</c>

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 align:start position:0%
on in North Korea and then you have
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.549 align:start position:0%
on in North Korea and then you have
everything<00:00:55.920><c> with</c><00:00:56.309><c> the</c><00:00:56.460><c> South</c><00:00:56.699><c> China</c><00:00:56.730><c> Sea</c>

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
everything with the South China Sea
 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.380 align:start position:0%
everything with the South China Sea
things<00:00:58.559><c> are</c><00:00:58.739><c> looking</c><00:00:59.070><c> very</c><00:00:59.100><c> crazy</c><00:00:59.969><c> right</c><00:01:00.359><c> now</c>

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
things are looking very crazy right now
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 align:start position:0%
things are looking very crazy right now
so<00:01:00.840><c> that's</c><00:01:01.079><c> giving</c><00:01:01.649><c> a</c><00:01:01.739><c> little</c><00:01:01.920><c> bit</c><00:01:02.129><c> of</c><00:01:02.190><c> this</c>

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
so that's giving a little bit of this
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.210 align:start position:0%
so that's giving a little bit of this
instability<00:01:02.910><c> and</c><00:01:03.570><c> as</c><00:01:03.899><c> a</c><00:01:03.930><c> result</c><00:01:04.439><c> gold</c><00:01:05.010><c> has</c>

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
instability and as a result gold has
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
instability and as a result gold has
risen<00:01:05.360><c> then</c><00:01:06.360><c> you</c><00:01:06.600><c> have</c><00:01:06.840><c> central</c><00:01:07.740><c> bank</c><00:01:08.330><c> actions</c>

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 align:start position:0%
risen then you have central bank actions
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.460 align:start position:0%
risen then you have central bank actions
so<00:01:09.630><c> will</c><00:01:10.020><c> Canada</c><00:01:11.869><c> increase</c><00:01:12.869><c> interest</c><00:01:13.260><c> rates</c>

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 align:start position:0%
so will Canada increase interest rates
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
so will Canada increase interest rates
well<00:01:13.710><c> they're</c><00:01:14.430><c> claiming</c><00:01:14.909><c> based</c><00:01:15.360><c> on</c><00:01:15.570><c> what</c><00:01:15.780><c> the</c>

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 align:start position:0%
well they're claiming based on what the
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 align:start position:0%
well they're claiming based on what the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
so called analysts and so-called
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.429 align:start position:0%
so called analysts and so-called

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 align:start position:0%
benchmark interest rate at 0.5% and I do
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 align:start position:0%
benchmark interest rate at 0.5% and I do

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
believe that they will do so I don't
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.410 align:start position:0%
believe that they will do so I don't
