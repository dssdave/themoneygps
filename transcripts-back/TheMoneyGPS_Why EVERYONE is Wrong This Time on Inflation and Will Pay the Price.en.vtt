so going on essentially saying you know
eventually<00:12:37.199><c> uh</c><00:12:37.320><c> we</c><00:12:37.440><c> would</c><00:12:37.600><c> get</c><00:12:37.720><c> to</c><00:12:37.880><c> this</c><00:12:38.120><c> day</c>

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
eventually uh we would get to this day
 

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.670 align:start position:0%
eventually uh we would get to this day
where<00:12:38.560><c> the</c><00:12:38.720><c> Reckoning</c><00:12:39.160><c> would</c><00:12:39.360><c> be</c><00:12:39.519><c> felt</c><00:12:40.240><c> but</c>

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
where the Reckoning would be felt but
 

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.110 align:start position:0%
where the Reckoning would be felt but
unfortunately<00:12:41.480><c> it</c><00:12:41.639><c> took</c><00:12:41.920><c> a</c><00:12:42.240><c> very</c><00:12:42.760><c> long</c><00:12:43.320><c> time</c>

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it took a very long time
 

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.150 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it took a very long time
and<00:12:44.320><c> here</c><00:12:44.480><c> we</c><00:12:44.760><c> are</c><00:12:45.760><c> this</c><00:12:45.880><c> is</c><00:12:46.120><c> the</c><00:12:46.519><c> unfortunate</c>

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
and here we are this is the unfortunate
 

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.030 align:start position:0%
and here we are this is the unfortunate
truth<00:12:47.760><c> about</c><00:12:47.959><c> the</c><00:12:48.079><c> world</c><00:12:48.320><c> that</c><00:12:48.480><c> we</c><00:12:48.639><c> live</c><00:12:48.800><c> in</c>

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
truth about the world that we live in
 

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.949 align:start position:0%
truth about the world that we live in
right<00:12:49.240><c> now</c><00:12:49.480><c> that</c><00:12:49.680><c> it</c><00:12:49.880><c> takes</c><00:12:50.120><c> a</c><00:12:50.320><c> long</c><00:12:50.639><c> time</c><00:12:50.800><c> to</c>

00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
right now that it takes a long time to
 

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:52.629 align:start position:0%
right now that it takes a long time to
move<00:12:51.199><c> through</c><00:12:51.480><c> these</c><00:12:51.680><c> Cycles</c><00:12:52.079><c> but</c><00:12:52.199><c> we</c><00:12:52.320><c> want</c><00:12:52.480><c> to</c>

00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
move through these Cycles but we want to
 

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:55.829 align:start position:0%
move through these Cycles but we want to
be<00:12:52.760><c> on</c><00:12:52.920><c> the</c><00:12:53.120><c> right</c><00:12:53.399><c> side</c><00:12:53.600><c> of</c><00:12:53.880><c> that</c><00:12:54.839><c> and</c><00:12:55.000><c> so</c><00:12:55.600><c> I</c>

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
be on the right side of that and so I
 

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
be on the right side of that and so I
