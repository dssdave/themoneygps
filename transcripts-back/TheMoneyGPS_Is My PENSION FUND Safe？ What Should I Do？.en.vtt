don't want to take the tax up front and
I<00:01:05.280><c> could</c><00:01:05.479><c> totally</c><00:01:06.240><c> understand</c><00:01:06.520><c> that</c><00:01:07.040><c> but</c><00:01:07.200><c> the</c>

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
I could totally understand that but the
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.190 align:start position:0%
I could totally understand that but the

and the reason why is because we make an

and the reason why is because we make an

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.429 align:start position:0%
don't know it's an assumption you hope
so<00:01:22.040><c> you</c><00:01:22.240><c> hope</c><00:01:22.479><c> that</c><00:01:22.640><c> the</c><00:01:22.880><c> government</c><00:01:23.280><c> will</c>

so you hope that the government will
 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.230 align:start position:0%
so you hope that the government will

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.589 align:start position:0%
panels so let's just take some round
numbers<00:02:41.599><c> for</c><00:02:41.760><c> example</c><00:02:42.159><c> let's</c><00:02:42.319><c> say</c><00:02:42.440><c> that</c>

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
numbers for example let's say that
 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.990 align:start position:0%
numbers for example let's say that

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and this would provide you with

that's<00:02:52.239><c> 30,000</c><00:02:53.120><c> let's</c><00:02:53.280><c> just</c><00:02:53.440><c> give</c><00:02:53.599><c> numbers</c>

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
that's 30,000 let's just give numbers
 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.030 align:start position:0%
that's 30,000 let's just give numbers
$30,000<00:02:55.920><c> and</c><00:02:56.040><c> then</c><00:02:56.200><c> you</c><00:02:56.360><c> grew</c><00:02:57.200><c> your</c><00:02:57.400><c> own</c><00:02:58.400><c> food</c>

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
