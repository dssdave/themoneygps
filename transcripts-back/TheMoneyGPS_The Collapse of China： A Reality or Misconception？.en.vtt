00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
it you should definitely have a plan B

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
and you should also have a plan C but I
 

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:17.189 align:start position:0%
and you should also have a plan C but I
think<00:12:14.560><c> a</c><00:12:14.680><c> lot</c><00:12:14.880><c> of</c><00:12:15.160><c> people</c><00:12:16.160><c> they</c><00:12:16.320><c> are</c><00:12:16.760><c> just</c>

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people they are just
 

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:19.629 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people they are just
