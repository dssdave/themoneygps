all right so in the example of the S&amp;P
500<00:03:20.200><c> that</c><00:03:20.319><c> $1,000</c><00:03:21.319><c> would</c><00:03:21.480><c> be</c><00:03:21.799><c> 1,700</c><00:03:23.120><c> today</c><00:03:24.120><c> and</c>

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.270 align:start position:0%
500 that $1,000 would be 1,700 today and
then<00:03:24.440><c> you</c><00:03:24.840><c> compare</c><00:03:25.280><c> that</c><00:03:25.799><c> to</c><00:03:25.959><c> the</c><00:03:26.120><c> Hong</c><00:03:26.519><c> sang</c>

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
then you compare that to the Hong sang
 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.350 align:start position:0%

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
which is you know at at 6 100 so it
 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.390 align:start position:0%
which is you know at at 6 100 so it

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
here what I think about Sweden is that
 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.070 align:start position:0%
here what I think about Sweden is that
they<00:04:55.840><c> have</c><00:04:56.520><c> gone</c><00:04:57.520><c> all</c><00:04:57.759><c> the</c><00:04:57.960><c> way</c><00:04:58.160><c> out</c><00:04:58.600><c> basically</c>

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
they have gone all the way out basically
 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.189 align:start position:0%
they have gone all the way out basically
there's<00:04:59.360><c> I</c><00:04:59.440><c> think</c>

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
there's I think
 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.230 align:start position:0%
there's I think
8%<00:05:01.199><c> is</c><00:05:01.520><c> actually</c><00:05:02.000><c> cash</c><00:05:02.360><c> so</c><00:05:02.600><c> they</c><00:05:02.800><c> just</c><00:05:03.000><c> keep</c>

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
8% is actually cash so they just keep
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.189 align:start position:0%
8% is actually cash so they just keep

to give up my cash the stores aren't
 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
to give up my cash the stores aren't

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.950 align:start position:0%
difficulty in that processing fees uh
hopefully<00:05:20.240><c> will</c><00:05:20.440><c> get</c><00:05:20.600><c> cheaper</c><00:05:20.960><c> and</c><00:05:21.160><c> cheaper</c>

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully will get cheaper and cheaper
 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.309 align:start position:0%
hopefully will get cheaper and cheaper
so<00:05:22.520><c> these</c><00:05:22.960><c> things</c><00:05:23.840><c> will</c><00:05:24.840><c> basically</c><00:05:25.360><c> make</c><00:05:25.680><c> that</c>

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
so these things will basically make that
