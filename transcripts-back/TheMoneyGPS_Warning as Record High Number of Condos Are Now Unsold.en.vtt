00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
6.63% at this time coming off basically
 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.870 align:start position:0%
6.63% at this time coming off basically
8%<00:01:10.600><c> okay</c><00:01:11.080><c> so</c><00:01:11.320><c> it</c><00:01:11.520><c> is</c><00:01:11.880><c> quite</c><00:01:12.040><c> a</c><00:01:12.119><c> bit</c><00:01:12.320><c> lower</c><00:01:12.759><c> and</c>

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
8% okay so it is quite a bit lower and
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
