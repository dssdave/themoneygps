very liquid market on the exchanges and
 

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.250 align:start position:0%
very liquid market on the exchanges and
that's<00:08:02.490><c> what</c><00:08:02.730><c> happens</c><00:08:03.120><c> you</c><00:08:03.600><c> want</c><00:08:03.870><c> to</c><00:08:03.990><c> get</c><00:08:04.110><c> your</c>

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's what happens you want to get your
 

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's what happens you want to get your

money out you want to get it at that
 

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
money out you want to get it at that
lowest<00:08:07.010><c> basically</c><00:08:08.010><c> that's</c><00:08:08.190><c> spread</c><00:08:08.610><c> that</c><00:08:09.030><c> the</c>

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.210 align:start position:0%
lowest basically that's spread that the
 

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.700 align:start position:0%
lowest basically that's spread that the
exists<00:08:09.780><c> you</c><00:08:09.900><c> want</c><00:08:10.110><c> to</c><00:08:10.200><c> basically</c><00:08:10.320><c> minimize</c>

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:10.710 align:start position:0%
exists you want to basically minimize
 

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.460 align:start position:0%
exists you want to basically minimize
that<00:08:11.100><c> so</c><00:08:11.370><c> the</c><00:08:11.520><c> more</c><00:08:11.760><c> liquid</c><00:08:12.420><c> something</c><00:08:13.020><c> is</c><00:08:13.200><c> the</c>

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:13.470 align:start position:0%
that so the more liquid something is the
 

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.620 align:start position:0%
that so the more liquid something is the
smaller<00:08:13.710><c> the</c><00:08:13.800><c> spread</c><00:08:14.160><c> will</c><00:08:14.370><c> be</c><00:08:14.520><c> and</c><00:08:14.820><c> then</c><00:08:15.180><c> you</c>

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:15.630 align:start position:0%
smaller the spread will be and then you
 

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.070 align:start position:0%
smaller the spread will be and then you
can<00:08:15.810><c> get</c><00:08:16.020><c> what</c><00:08:16.560><c> you</c><00:08:16.590><c> are</c><00:08:16.980><c> looking</c><00:08:17.490><c> for</c><00:08:17.720><c> but</c><00:08:18.720><c> if</c>

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
can get what you are looking for but if
