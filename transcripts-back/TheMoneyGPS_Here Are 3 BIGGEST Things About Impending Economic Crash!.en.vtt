00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
number three you can see the yield curve
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 align:start position:0%
number three you can see the yield curve
inversion<00:00:37.079><c> and</c><00:00:37.500><c> what</c><00:00:37.680><c> does</c><00:00:37.860><c> that</c><00:00:37.980><c> all</c><00:00:38.160><c> mean</c>

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
inversion and what does that all mean
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.350 align:start position:0%
inversion and what does that all mean
the<00:00:39.239><c> bond</c><00:00:39.540><c> market</c><00:00:39.899><c> is</c><00:00:40.500><c> signaling</c><00:00:41.160><c> a</c><00:00:41.760><c> imminent</c>

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
recession and you can look at it on
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.150 align:start position:0%
recession and you can look at it on
different<00:00:45.180><c> forms</c><00:00:45.719><c> but</c><00:00:46.260><c> this</c><00:00:46.500><c> is</c><00:00:46.620><c> what</c><00:00:46.860><c> we</c><00:00:47.040><c> can</c>

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
different forms but this is what we can
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.369 align:start position:0%
different forms but this is what we can
see<00:00:47.340><c> with</c><00:00:47.700><c> the</c><00:00:47.879><c> yield</c><00:00:48.120><c> curve</c><00:00:48.539><c> inversion</c><00:00:49.020><c> and</c>

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 align:start position:0%
see with the yield curve inversion and
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.670 align:start position:0%
see with the yield curve inversion and
that<00:00:49.620><c> is</c><00:00:49.860><c> of</c><00:00:50.160><c> course</c><00:00:50.280><c> the</c><00:00:51.239><c> longer</c><00:00:51.660><c> dated</c><00:00:52.020><c> debt</c>

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
that is of course the longer dated debt
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 align:start position:0%
that is of course the longer dated debt
is<00:00:53.340><c> not</c><00:00:53.640><c> giving</c><00:00:54.059><c> the</c><00:00:54.420><c> returns</c><00:00:54.780><c> of</c><00:00:55.020><c> the</c><00:00:55.140><c> shorter</c>
