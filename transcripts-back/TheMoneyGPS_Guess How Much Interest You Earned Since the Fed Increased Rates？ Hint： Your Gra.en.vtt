truck sales and I would have to say that
 

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:18.030 align:start position:0%
truck sales and I would have to say that
it<00:11:16.160><c> seems</c><00:11:17.160><c> like</c><00:11:17.360><c> these</c><00:11:17.519><c> numbers</c><00:11:17.839><c> have</c>

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
it seems like these numbers have

that is fluctuating all the time we can

that is fluctuating all the time we can

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
mean you can see the trend though from
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.990 align:start position:0%
mean you can see the trend though from
