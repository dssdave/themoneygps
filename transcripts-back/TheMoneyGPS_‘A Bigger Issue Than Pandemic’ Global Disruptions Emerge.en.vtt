just basically fall to nothing and while
 

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.629 align:start position:0%
just basically fall to nothing and while
they<00:08:13.360><c> might</c><00:08:13.560><c> have</c><00:08:13.800><c> given</c><00:08:14.199><c> safe</c><00:08:14.599><c> passage</c><00:08:15.360><c> to</c>

they might have given safe passage to
 

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:20.230 align:start position:0%
they might have given safe passage to

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
Russia and China's ships uh you know

Russia and China's ships uh you know
it's<00:08:20.440><c> just</c><00:08:20.759><c> it's</c><00:08:20.840><c> a</c><00:08:21.000><c> big</c><00:08:21.199><c> problem</c><00:08:21.479><c> so</c><00:08:21.879><c> this</c><00:08:22.000><c> is</c>

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a big problem so this is
 

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.629 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a big problem so this is
It's<00:08:22.599><c> might</c><00:08:22.720><c> be</c><00:08:22.840><c> hard</c><00:08:22.960><c> to</c><00:08:23.080><c> see</c><00:08:23.280><c> cuz</c><00:08:23.440><c> all</c><00:08:23.520><c> the</c>

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:29.309 align:start position:0%
even when I zoomed in I was still

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%

the<00:08:38.320><c> Red</c><00:08:38.519><c> Sea</c><00:08:38.880><c> the</c><00:08:39.080><c> costs</c><00:08:39.479><c> are</c><00:08:39.800><c> going</c><00:08:40.159><c> to</c><00:08:40.399><c> be</c>

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
the Red Sea the costs are going to be
 

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.190 align:start position:0%
the Red Sea the costs are going to be
significantly<00:08:42.240><c> higher</c><00:08:42.800><c> it</c><00:08:43.000><c> jumped</c><00:08:43.800><c> just</c><00:08:43.959><c> like</c>

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
significantly higher it jumped just like
 

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.030 align:start position:0%
significantly higher it jumped just like
that<00:08:44.600><c> and</c><00:08:44.720><c> of</c><00:08:44.839><c> course</c><00:08:45.000><c> what</c><00:08:45.080><c> do</c><00:08:45.279><c> this</c><00:08:45.440><c> do</c>

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
that and of course what do this do
 

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.230 align:start position:0%
that and of course what do this do
delays<00:08:46.839><c> the</c><00:08:47.120><c> time</c><00:08:47.519><c> in</c><00:08:47.760><c> which</c><00:08:47.920><c> it</c><00:08:48.080><c> takes</c><00:08:48.399><c> from</c><00:08:48.640><c> a</c>

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
delays the time in which it takes from a
 

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.670 align:start position:0%
delays the time in which it takes from a
point<00:08:49.440><c> A</c><00:08:49.600><c> to</c><00:08:49.760><c> point</c><00:08:49.959><c> B</c><00:08:50.600><c> and</c><00:08:50.760><c> also</c><00:08:51.000><c> increase</c><00:08:51.440><c> the</c>

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
point A to point B and also increase the
 

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.389 align:start position:0%
point A to point B and also increase the
cost<00:08:52.680><c> there's</c><00:08:52.880><c> no</c><00:08:53.040><c> question</c><00:08:53.399><c> about</c><00:08:53.680><c> that</c><00:08:54.120><c> so</c>

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
cost there's no question about that so
 

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.750 align:start position:0%
cost there's no question about that so
then<00:08:54.720><c> you</c><00:08:54.839><c> know</c><00:08:55.320><c> if</c><00:08:55.440><c> they</c><00:08:55.680><c> go</c>

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
then you know if they go
 

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.230 align:start position:0%
then you know if they go
around<00:08:57.760><c> um</c><00:08:58.240><c> if</c><00:08:58.360><c> they</c><00:08:58.480><c> go</c><00:08:58.640><c> around</c><00:08:58.800><c> South</c><00:08:58.959><c> Africa</c>

00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
around um if they go around South Africa
 

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.310 align:start position:0%
around um if they go around South Africa
Africa<00:09:00.079><c> that</c><00:09:00.360><c> adds</c><00:09:00.880><c> I</c><00:09:00.959><c> think</c><00:09:01.200><c> they</c><00:09:01.320><c> said</c><00:09:01.680><c> 10</c><00:09:02.000><c> to</c>

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
Africa that adds I think they said 10 to
 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.870 align:start position:0%
Africa that adds I think they said 10 to
12<00:09:03.320><c> days</c><00:09:04.320><c> of</c><00:09:04.959><c> time</c><00:09:05.959><c> and</c><00:09:06.120><c> so</c><00:09:06.560><c> that</c><00:09:06.959><c> you</c><00:09:07.120><c> know</c><00:09:07.720><c> if</c>

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
12 days of time and so that you know if
 

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
12 days of time and so that you know if
each<00:09:08.160><c> ship</c><00:09:08.480><c> 10</c><00:09:08.640><c> to</c><00:09:08.760><c> 12</c><00:09:09.000><c> Days</c><00:09:09.160><c> 10</c><00:09:09.320><c> to</c><00:09:09.440><c> 12</c><00:09:09.760><c> days</c>

this<00:09:10.519><c> this</c><00:09:10.720><c> slows</c><00:09:11.600><c> everything</c><00:09:12.079><c> down</c><00:09:13.040><c> and</c><00:09:13.160><c> so</c>

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
this this slows everything down and so
 

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.990 align:start position:0%
this this slows everything down and so
you<00:09:13.519><c> got</c><00:09:13.640><c> a</c><00:09:13.760><c> big</c><00:09:14.000><c> problem</c><00:09:14.480><c> I</c><00:09:14.519><c> don't</c><00:09:14.680><c> see</c><00:09:14.880><c> it</c>

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
you got a big problem I don't see it
 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.990 align:start position:0%

so<00:09:48.279><c> we'll</c><00:09:48.440><c> see</c><00:09:48.640><c> what</c><00:09:48.800><c> happens</c><00:09:49.279><c> there</c><00:09:49.720><c> but</c><00:09:49.880><c> of</c>

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll see what happens there but of
 

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.150 align:start position:0%
so we'll see what happens there but of
course<00:09:50.360><c> means</c><00:09:50.959><c> higher</c><00:09:51.279><c> inflation</c><00:09:51.800><c> higher</c>

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
course means higher inflation higher

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.910 align:start position:0%
coal and so you could see the demand is
certainly<00:11:32.880><c> there</c><00:11:33.720><c> it</c><00:11:34.000><c> it's</c><00:11:34.240><c> not</c><00:11:34.440><c> subsiding</c>

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%

anytime<00:11:35.279><c> soon</c><00:11:35.519><c> it</c><00:11:35.680><c> started</c><00:11:36.040><c> going</c><00:11:36.320><c> crazy</c><00:11:36.639><c> in</c>

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
20120 and um you could see that that's
 

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.629 align:start position:0%
20120 and um you could see that that's

is<00:11:42.760><c> it</c><00:11:42.920><c> going</c><00:11:43.279><c> so</c><00:11:43.440><c> there's</c><00:11:43.639><c> always</c><00:11:43.839><c> two</c><00:11:44.000><c> sides</c>

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
is it going so there's always two sides
 

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.990 align:start position:0%
is it going so there's always two sides
