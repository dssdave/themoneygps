let's begin first things first you can
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.950 align:start position:0%
let's begin first things first you can
see<00:00:35.040><c> why</c><00:00:35.239><c> is</c><00:00:35.480><c> growth</c><00:00:35.920><c> so</c><00:00:36.480><c> strong</c><00:00:37.239><c> one</c><00:00:37.559><c> factor</c>

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
see why is growth so strong one factor
 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.990 align:start position:0%
see why is growth so strong one factor
has<00:00:38.120><c> been</c><00:00:38.360><c> government</c><00:00:38.760><c> spending</c><00:00:39.320><c> which</c><00:00:39.559><c> grew</c>

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
has been government spending which grew
 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
has been government spending which grew
at<00:00:40.160><c> an</c>

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.549 align:start position:0%
4.7% in real terms over the last year
and<00:00:48.000><c> so</c><00:00:48.239><c> we</c><00:00:48.360><c> can</c><00:00:48.480><c> see</c><00:00:48.680><c> that</c><00:00:48.879><c> this</c><00:00:49.120><c> the</c><00:00:49.360><c> one</c><00:00:49.480><c> of</c>
