officially<00:00:57.440><c> a</c><00:00:57.760><c> pivot</c><00:00:58.239><c> but</c><00:00:58.519><c> what</c><00:00:58.800><c> happens</c><00:00:59.320><c> here</c>

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
officially a pivot but what happens here
 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.549 align:start position:0%
officially a pivot but what happens here
is<00:01:00.239><c> that</c><00:01:00.600><c> investors</c><00:01:01.280><c> would</c><00:01:01.760><c> look</c><00:01:02.000><c> at</c><00:01:02.239><c> this</c>

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
is that investors would look at this
 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.910 align:start position:0%
is that investors would look at this
historically<00:01:03.320><c> and</c><00:01:03.519><c> say</c><00:01:04.360><c> during</c><00:01:04.720><c> these</c>

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
historically and say during these
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.070 align:start position:0%
historically and say during these
periods<00:01:05.280><c> of</c><00:01:05.920><c> time</c><00:01:06.920><c> what</c><00:01:07.119><c> is</c><00:01:07.280><c> the</c><00:01:07.479><c> chance</c><00:01:07.880><c> that</c>

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
periods of time what is the chance that
 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.149 align:start position:0%
periods of time what is the chance that
the<00:01:08.240><c> stock</c><00:01:08.520><c> market</c><00:01:08.880><c> goes</c><00:01:09.200><c> down</c><00:01:10.159><c> considerably</c>

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
the stock market goes down considerably
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.429 align:start position:0%
the stock market goes down considerably
and<00:01:11.240><c> so</c><00:01:11.479><c> they</c><00:01:11.600><c> would</c><00:01:11.840><c> weigh</c><00:01:12.479><c> those</c><00:01:12.920><c> options</c>

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
and so they would weigh those options
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.270 align:start position:0%
and so they would weigh those options
out<00:01:14.400><c> the</c><00:01:14.680><c> thought</c><00:01:15.080><c> here</c><00:01:15.400><c> is</c><00:01:15.560><c> that</c><00:01:16.000><c> they</c><00:01:16.119><c> are</c>

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
out the thought here is that they are
 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.070 align:start position:0%
out the thought here is that they are
going<00:01:16.439><c> to</c><00:01:16.720><c> front</c><00:01:17.200><c> run</c><00:01:17.840><c> the</c><00:01:18.119><c> eventual</c><00:01:18.680><c> rate</c>

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 align:start position:0%

is if we don't take care of inflation
now<00:01:59.840><c> it</c><00:02:00.439><c> resurges</c><00:02:01.439><c> even</c><00:02:01.799><c> worse</c><00:02:02.240><c> at</c><00:02:02.360><c> a</c><00:02:02.479><c> later</c>

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 align:start position:0%

meeting okay if they wait to 2% and then
 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.270 align:start position:0%
meeting okay if they wait to 2% and then
they<00:02:40.879><c> start</c><00:02:41.560><c> cutting</c><00:02:42.560><c> then</c><00:02:42.720><c> they</c><00:02:42.879><c> will</c>

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
they start cutting then they will
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.470 align:start position:0%
they start cutting then they will
overshoot<00:02:44.280><c> this</c><00:02:44.400><c> is</c><00:02:44.560><c> what</c><00:02:44.800><c> Powell</c><00:02:45.200><c> said</c><00:02:45.400><c> it</c>

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
overshoot this is what Powell said it
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.869 align:start position:0%
overshoot this is what Powell said it
will<00:02:45.760><c> overshoot</c><00:02:46.760><c> because</c><00:02:47.000><c> there's</c><00:02:47.400><c> always</c>

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
will overshoot because there's always
 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.630 align:start position:0%
will overshoot because there's always
you<00:02:47.959><c> know</c><00:02:48.200><c> back</c><00:02:48.400><c> in</c><00:02:48.640><c> time</c><00:02:48.959><c> it's</c><00:02:49.239><c> always</c><00:02:49.519><c> going</c>

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
you know back in time it's always going
 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.470 align:start position:0%
you know back in time it's always going
to<00:02:49.720><c> be</c><00:02:49.840><c> a</c><00:02:50.200><c> lag</c><00:02:51.200><c> and</c><00:02:51.319><c> so</c><00:02:51.599><c> they've</c><00:02:51.800><c> got</c><00:02:51.920><c> to</c><00:02:52.120><c> be</c>

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
to be a lag and so they've got to be
 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.790 align:start position:0%
to be a lag and so they've got to be

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
and so anytime now they could start to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
cut rates because they don't want to
 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.309 align:start position:0%
cut rates because they don't want to

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 align:start position:0%

a bit from where we are on the FED funds
rate<00:06:59.759><c> right</c><00:06:59.879><c> now</c><00:07:00.039><c> it's</c><00:07:00.199><c> at</c><00:07:00.560><c> it's</c><00:07:00.720><c> at</c><00:07:01.000><c> between</c>

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
rate right now it's at it's at between
 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.309 align:start position:0%

5.25<00:07:02.440><c> and</c><00:07:03.120><c> 5.5%</c><00:07:04.120><c> so</c><00:07:04.360><c> bringing</c><00:07:04.720><c> it</c><00:07:05.000><c> down</c><00:07:05.639><c> to</c><00:07:06.240><c> you</c>

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.990 align:start position:0%
5.25 and 5.5% so bringing it down to you
know<00:07:06.680><c> 4%</c><00:07:07.680><c> seems</c><00:07:08.160><c> pretty</c><00:07:08.520><c> reasonable</c><00:07:09.440><c> you</c><00:07:09.560><c> know</c>

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
know 4% seems pretty reasonable you know
 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.830 align:start position:0%
know 4% seems pretty reasonable you know
to<00:07:10.160><c> expect</c><00:07:10.440><c> that</c><00:07:10.599><c> who</c><00:07:10.759><c> knows</c><00:07:11.039><c> what</c><00:07:11.199><c> happens</c><00:07:11.560><c> by</c>

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
to expect that who knows what happens by
 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.710 align:start position:0%
to expect that who knows what happens by
then<00:07:12.840><c> uh</c><00:07:13.039><c> but</c><00:07:13.560><c> shows</c><00:07:14.120><c> us</c><00:07:15.120><c> what</c><00:07:15.840><c> could</c><00:07:16.199><c> occur</c>

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
then uh but shows us what could occur
 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.309 align:start position:0%
then uh but shows us what could occur
now<00:07:17.000><c> that</c><00:07:17.199><c> has</c><00:07:17.360><c> been</c><00:07:17.599><c> you</c><00:07:17.720><c> can</c><00:07:17.840><c> see</c><00:07:18.000><c> how</c><00:07:18.160><c> it's</c>

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
