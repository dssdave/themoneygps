00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
things come down if we do it at the

and why you should know about this is
 

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.930 align:start position:0%
and why you should know about this is

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
banks are set to zero percent right now
 

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.410 align:start position:0%
banks are set to zero percent right now
zero<00:09:31.320><c> they</c><00:09:31.440><c> don't</c><00:09:31.740><c> have</c><00:09:32.279><c> to</c><00:09:32.459><c> keep</c><00:09:32.640><c> reserved</c><00:09:33.060><c> so</c>

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
zero they don't have to keep reserved so
 

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.070 align:start position:0%
zero they don't have to keep reserved so
technically<00:09:34.279><c> all</c><00:09:35.279><c> of</c><00:09:35.459><c> these</c><00:09:35.700><c> reserves</c><00:09:36.300><c> are</c>

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
technically all of these reserves are
 

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.250 align:start position:0%
technically all of these reserves are
excess<00:09:37.980><c> reserves</c><00:09:38.820><c> on</c><00:09:39.480><c> top</c><00:09:39.600><c> of</c><00:09:39.839><c> which</c><00:09:39.959><c> the</c>

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
excess reserves on top of which the
 

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.190 align:start position:0%
excess reserves on top of which the

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
banks can multiply credit
 

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.410 align:start position:0%
banks can multiply credit
so<00:09:43.740><c> there's</c><00:09:44.040><c> the</c><00:09:44.459><c> reserve</c><00:09:44.880><c> requirements</c>

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
so there's the reserve requirements
 

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
so there's the reserve requirements
let's<00:09:45.600><c> just</c><00:09:45.720><c> say</c><00:09:45.839><c> they</c><00:09:45.959><c> have</c><00:09:46.140><c> to</c><00:09:46.260><c> keep</c><00:09:46.380><c> 10</c><00:09:46.620><c> in</c>

let's just say they have to keep 10 in
 

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.350 align:start position:0%
let's just say they have to keep 10 in
there<00:09:47.160><c> you</c><00:09:47.339><c> know</c><00:09:47.459><c> fractional</c><00:09:47.940><c> Reserve</c>

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
there you know fractional Reserve
 

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.490 align:start position:0%
there you know fractional Reserve
banking<00:09:48.720><c> right</c>

that's a okay you got to keep 10 oh we
 

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.810 align:start position:0%
that's a okay you got to keep 10 oh we

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
have a crisis now okay let's bring that
 

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
have a crisis now okay let's bring that
to<00:09:54.000><c> zero</c><00:09:54.480><c> so</c><00:09:54.839><c> now</c><00:09:55.200><c> all</c><00:09:55.620><c> of</c><00:09:55.800><c> that</c><00:09:56.040><c> so</c><00:09:56.399><c> from</c><00:09:56.640><c> the</c>

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
to zero so now all of that so from the
 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.810 align:start position:0%
to zero so now all of that so from the
10<00:09:56.880><c> bring</c><00:09:57.480><c> it</c><00:09:57.660><c> all</c><00:09:57.839><c> the</c><00:09:57.959><c> way</c><00:09:57.959><c> down</c><00:09:58.140><c> to</c><00:09:58.320><c> zero</c><00:09:58.820><c> all</c>

00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
10 bring it all the way down to zero all
 

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.750 align:start position:0%
10 bring it all the way down to zero all
of<00:10:00.000><c> that</c><00:10:00.180><c> is</c><00:10:00.420><c> excess</c><00:10:00.899><c> reserves</c><00:10:01.560><c> and</c><00:10:02.339><c> so</c><00:10:02.580><c> they</c>

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that is excess reserves and so they
 

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.590 align:start position:0%
of that is excess reserves and so they
can<00:10:02.940><c> use</c><00:10:03.360><c> that</c><00:10:03.779><c> to</c><00:10:04.620><c> create</c><00:10:05.040><c> more</c><00:10:05.580><c> credit</c><00:10:05.820><c> to</c>

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
can use that to create more credit to
 

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.949 align:start position:0%
can use that to create more credit to
stimulate<00:10:07.140><c> more</c><00:10:07.440><c> to</c><00:10:07.980><c> add</c><00:10:08.339><c> more</c><00:10:08.700><c> liquidity</c>

00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
stimulate more to add more liquidity
 

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
stimulate more to add more liquidity
so<00:10:10.500><c> yeah</c><00:10:10.620><c> they're</c><00:10:11.040><c> draining</c><00:10:11.459><c> liquidity</c>

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah they're draining liquidity
 

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.670 align:start position:0%
so yeah they're draining liquidity
through<00:10:12.240><c> the</c><00:10:12.420><c> quantitative</c><00:10:12.839><c> tightening</c><00:10:13.380><c> it's</c>

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
through the quantitative tightening it's
 

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
through the quantitative tightening it's

there's<00:10:19.920><c> no</c><00:10:20.100><c> crisis</c><00:10:20.640><c> but</c><00:10:21.300><c> clearly</c><00:10:21.600><c> there</c><00:10:21.899><c> is</c>

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's no crisis but clearly there is
 

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
there's no crisis but clearly there is
because<00:10:22.800><c> the</c><00:10:23.339><c> banks</c><00:10:23.820><c> they're</c><00:10:24.480><c> operating</c><00:10:25.080><c> in</c>

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
because the banks they're operating in
 

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.130 align:start position:0%
because the banks they're operating in
like<00:10:25.980><c> freakout</c><00:10:26.580><c> Zone</c><00:10:27.000><c> and</c><00:10:27.720><c> that's</c><00:10:27.899><c> what's</c>

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
like freakout Zone and that's what's
 

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.810 align:start position:0%
like freakout Zone and that's what's
going<00:10:28.440><c> on</c><00:10:28.680><c> today</c>

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
going on today
 

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
going on today
hope<00:10:30.240><c> you</c><00:10:30.420><c> get</c><00:10:30.600><c> me</c><00:10:30.779><c> on</c><00:10:31.080><c> that</c><00:10:31.260><c> okay</c><00:10:31.500><c> big</c><00:10:32.160><c> stuff</c>

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
hope you get me on that okay big stuff
 

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.850 align:start position:0%
hope you get me on that okay big stuff
this<00:10:32.820><c> may</c><00:10:33.000><c> explain</c><00:10:33.240><c> why</c><00:10:33.779><c> lending</c><00:10:34.260><c> is</c>

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
this may explain why lending is
 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.850 align:start position:0%
this may explain why lending is
relatively<00:10:35.640><c> strong</c><00:10:36.240><c> despite</c><00:10:36.959><c> the</c><00:10:37.200><c> rate</c><00:10:37.380><c> hikes</c>

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
relatively strong despite the rate hikes
 

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.970 align:start position:0%
relatively strong despite the rate hikes
so<00:10:38.459><c> rates</c><00:10:38.940><c> are</c><00:10:39.180><c> still</c><00:10:39.480><c> ex</c><00:10:39.720><c> pretty</c><00:10:40.200><c> high</c><00:10:40.440><c> I</c><00:10:40.860><c> mean</c>

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
so rates are still ex pretty high I mean
 

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.070 align:start position:0%
so rates are still ex pretty high I mean
historically<00:10:41.519><c> anyway</c><00:10:41.820><c> when</c><00:10:42.540><c> you</c><00:10:42.660><c> look</c><00:10:42.839><c> at</c>

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
historically anyway when you look at
 

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.530 align:start position:0%
historically anyway when you look at
this<00:10:43.320><c> uh</c><00:10:44.100><c> they</c><00:10:44.339><c> you</c><00:10:44.640><c> know</c><00:10:44.700><c> should</c><00:10:45.060><c> be</c><00:10:45.240><c> higher</c>

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
this uh they you know should be higher
 

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.810 align:start position:0%
this uh they you know should be higher
but<00:10:45.660><c> anyway</c><00:10:45.839><c> based</c><00:10:46.380><c> on</c><00:10:46.380><c> inflation</c><00:10:46.740><c> but</c>

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
but anyway based on inflation but
 

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.810 align:start position:0%
but anyway based on inflation but
let's<00:10:48.540><c> take</c><00:10:48.839><c> what</c><00:10:49.140><c> we</c><00:10:49.320><c> can</c><00:10:49.440><c> get</c><00:10:49.620><c> this</c><00:10:50.579><c> is</c>

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
let's take what we can get this is
 

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.210 align:start position:0%
let's take what we can get this is
important<00:10:51.180><c> because</c><00:10:51.600><c> we</c><00:10:52.560><c> have</c><00:10:52.680><c> to</c><00:10:52.800><c> start</c><00:10:53.100><c> to</c>

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
important because we have to start to
 

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.670 align:start position:0%
important because we have to start to
address<00:10:53.399><c> like</c><00:10:53.700><c> why</c><00:10:54.240><c> is</c><00:10:54.480><c> you</c><00:10:55.140><c> know</c><00:10:55.200><c> the</c><00:10:55.320><c> system</c>

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
address like why is you know the system
 

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.050 align:start position:0%
address like why is you know the system
