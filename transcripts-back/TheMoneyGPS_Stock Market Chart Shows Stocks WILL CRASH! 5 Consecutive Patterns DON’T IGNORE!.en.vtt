about once a month or so you should
 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.390 align:start position:0%
about once a month or so you should
measure<00:03:17.319><c> these</c><00:03:18.159><c> and</c><00:03:18.400><c> just</c><00:03:18.560><c> see</c><00:03:18.840><c> where</c><00:03:19.080><c> things</c>

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
