is<00:01:56.640><c> that</c><00:01:57.079><c> okay</c><00:01:57.640><c> so</c><00:01:57.920><c> when</c><00:01:58.200><c> we</c><00:01:58.719><c> um</c><00:01:58.880><c> you</c><00:01:59.000><c> know</c><00:01:59.159><c> the</c>

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
is that okay so when we um you know the
 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.069 align:start position:0%
is that okay so when we um you know the
simplest<00:01:59.560><c> way</c><00:01:59.640><c> to</c><00:01:59.920><c> explain</c><00:02:00.200><c> it</c><00:02:00.560><c> as</c><00:02:00.640><c> I</c><00:02:00.799><c> always</c>

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
simplest way to explain it as I always
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.510 align:start position:0%
simplest way to explain it as I always
do<00:02:01.640><c> is</c><00:02:01.840><c> that</c><00:02:02.039><c> if</c><00:02:02.159><c> you're</c><00:02:02.399><c> going</c><00:02:02.600><c> to</c><00:02:02.840><c> buy</c><00:02:03.079><c> a</c><00:02:03.240><c> bond</c>

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
do is that if you're going to buy a bond
 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.270 align:start position:0%
do is that if you're going to buy a bond
then<00:02:03.640><c> it's</c><00:02:03.759><c> going</c><00:02:03.840><c> to</c><00:02:03.920><c> be</c><00:02:04.039><c> a</c><00:02:04.200><c> super</c><00:02:04.600><c> long</c><00:02:05.000><c> one</c>

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
then it's going to be a super long one
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.550 align:start position:0%
then it's going to be a super long one
let's<00:02:05.439><c> say</c><00:02:05.640><c> 30</c><00:02:06.039><c> years</c><00:02:06.799><c> well</c><00:02:06.960><c> you</c><00:02:07.079><c> would</c><00:02:07.320><c> think</c>

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
let's say 30 years well you would think
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 align:start position:0%
let's say 30 years well you would think
that<00:02:07.759><c> a</c><00:02:08.039><c> 30-year</c><00:02:08.759><c> Bond</c><00:02:09.039><c> will</c><00:02:09.200><c> give</c><00:02:09.319><c> you</c><00:02:09.440><c> a</c>

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
that a 30-year Bond will give you a
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.830 align:start position:0%
that a 30-year Bond will give you a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
better return than let's say one year
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
better return than let's say one year
right<00:02:13.080><c> you're</c><00:02:13.239><c> taking</c><00:02:13.640><c> much</c><00:02:13.879><c> more</c><00:02:14.160><c> risk</c><00:02:14.440><c> you</c>

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
right you're taking much more risk you
 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.229 align:start position:0%
right you're taking much more risk you
go<00:02:14.760><c> out</c><00:02:14.840><c> to</c><00:02:14.959><c> hold</c><00:02:15.120><c> it</c><00:02:15.239><c> for</c><00:02:15.400><c> 30</c><00:02:15.640><c> years</c><00:02:15.879><c> so</c><00:02:16.000><c> you</c>

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
go out to hold it for 30 years so you
 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.030 align:start position:0%
go out to hold it for 30 years so you
expect<00:02:16.480><c> a</c><00:02:16.599><c> better</c><00:02:17.239><c> return</c><00:02:18.239><c> however</c><00:02:18.879><c> what</c>

expect a better return however what
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.070 align:start position:0%
expect a better return however what

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.190 align:start position:0%

they<00:02:22.400><c> flip</c><00:02:22.959><c> the</c><00:02:23.120><c> other</c><00:02:23.400><c> way</c><00:02:23.680><c> and</c><00:02:23.879><c> you</c><00:02:24.040><c> actually</c>

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
they flip the other way and you actually
 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.229 align:start position:0%
they flip the other way and you actually
get<00:02:24.319><c> a</c><00:02:24.519><c> better</c><00:02:24.959><c> return</c><00:02:25.519><c> on</c><00:02:25.800><c> the</c><00:02:26.080><c> shorter</c><00:02:26.640><c> dated</c>

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
get a better return on the shorter dated
 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.630 align:start position:0%
get a better return on the shorter dated
debt<00:02:28.000><c> and</c><00:02:28.120><c> so</c><00:02:28.519><c> that</c><00:02:28.800><c> happens</c><00:02:29.200><c> it's</c><00:02:29.280><c> a</c><00:02:29.400><c> yield</c>

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 align:start position:0%

know the details it's like if this then
that<00:07:16.840><c> right</c><00:07:16.960><c> it's</c><00:07:17.160><c> programming</c><00:07:17.800><c> language</c><00:07:18.800><c> and</c>

that right it's programming language and
