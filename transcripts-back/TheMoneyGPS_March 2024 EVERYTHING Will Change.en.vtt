and they have to increase again just
 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.589 align:start position:0%
and they have to increase again just
like<00:06:21.479><c> they</c><00:06:21.639><c> did</c><00:06:21.919><c> in</c><00:06:22.039><c> the</c><00:06:22.199><c> 1970s</c><00:06:23.039><c> for</c><00:06:23.599><c> instance</c>

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
like they did in the 1970s for instance
 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.510 align:start position:0%
like they did in the 1970s for instance
yes<00:06:25.039><c> it's</c><00:06:25.560><c> possible</c><00:06:26.560><c> but</c><00:06:26.800><c> not</c><00:06:27.360><c> likely</c><00:06:28.360><c> all</c>

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
yes it's possible but not likely all
 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.110 align:start position:0%
yes it's possible but not likely all
right<00:06:29.000><c> and</c><00:06:29.120><c> so</c><00:06:29.479><c> this</c><00:06:29.599><c> is</c><00:06:29.800><c> the</c><00:06:30.120><c> uh</c><00:06:30.319><c> last</c><00:06:30.800><c> hike</c>

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
right and so this is the uh last hike
 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
right and so this is the uh last hike
you<00:06:31.240><c> can</c><00:06:31.400><c> see</c><00:06:31.720><c> that</c><00:06:32.199><c> um</c><00:06:32.560><c> comparing</c><00:06:33.039><c> that</c><00:06:33.199><c> at</c>

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
you can see that um comparing that at
 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.790 align:start position:0%
you can see that um comparing that at

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
the next hike where it was how long the

the next hike where it was how long the

there's<00:06:49.599><c> no</c><00:06:49.840><c> question</c><00:06:50.160><c> about</c><00:06:50.360><c> it</c><00:06:51.120><c> but</c><00:06:51.360><c> what</c><00:06:51.479><c> do</c>

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it but what do
 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.550 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it but what do

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.350 align:start position:0%
we know about Central Bankers it's that
they<00:06:53.759><c> want</c><00:06:54.280><c> to</c><00:06:54.599><c> create</c><00:06:54.919><c> more</c><00:06:55.240><c> inflation</c><00:06:55.960><c> doing</c>

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
they want to create more inflation doing
