00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
can sort of shift this based on how long
 

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.110 align:start position:0%
can sort of shift this based on how long
you<00:09:28.399><c> pull</c><00:09:28.640><c> it</c><00:09:28.760><c> out</c><00:09:29.000><c> for</c><00:09:29.480><c> and</c><00:09:29.640><c> everything</c><00:09:29.880><c> else</c>

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
you pull it out for and everything else
 

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
you pull it out for and everything else
but<00:09:30.240><c> the</c><00:09:30.360><c> point</c><00:09:30.640><c> is</c><00:09:31.440><c> when</c><00:09:32.360><c> there's</c><00:09:32.800><c> too</c><00:09:32.959><c> much</c>

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
but the point is when there's too much
 

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
but the point is when there's too much
of<00:09:33.320><c> a</c><00:09:33.800><c> Divergence</c><00:09:34.800><c> it</c><00:09:35.040><c> usually</c><00:09:35.399><c> will</c><00:09:36.200><c> converge</c>

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
of a Divergence it usually will converge
 

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
of a Divergence it usually will converge
and<00:09:37.440><c> and</c><00:09:37.519><c> it</c><00:09:37.640><c> won't</c><00:09:37.959><c> happen</c><00:09:38.360><c> like</c><00:09:38.519><c> you're</c><00:09:38.680><c> not</c>

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
going to see it coming it just happens
 

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
going to see it coming it just happens
and<00:09:42.760><c> I</c><00:09:42.959><c> believe</c><00:09:43.360><c> that</c><00:09:43.560><c> it's</c><00:09:44.240><c> um</c><00:09:45.079><c> it's</c><00:09:45.360><c> usually</c>

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I believe that it's um it's usually
 

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.430 align:start position:0%
and I believe that it's um it's usually
when<00:09:46.240><c> people</c><00:09:47.240><c> think</c><00:09:47.560><c> that</c><00:09:47.720><c> it</c><00:09:47.880><c> will</c><00:09:48.120><c> never</c>

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
when people think that it will never
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.150 align:start position:0%
when people think that it will never
