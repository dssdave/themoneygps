00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.390 align:start position:0%
We are headed for a crash. But of
course,<00:01:38.320><c> we</c><00:01:38.560><c> have</c><00:01:38.720><c> to</c><00:01:38.880><c> use</c><00:01:39.360><c> inverse</c><00:01:39.840><c> Kramer</c>

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
course, we have to use inverse Kramer
 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.190 align:start position:0%
course, we have to use inverse Kramer
because<00:01:41.360><c> he</c><00:01:41.600><c> tends</c><00:01:41.840><c> to</c><00:01:42.000><c> not</c><00:01:42.240><c> be</c><00:01:42.479><c> uh</c><00:01:42.720><c> exactly</c>

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
because he tends to not be uh exactly
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.469 align:start position:0%
because he tends to not be uh exactly
accurate.<00:01:44.159><c> Uh</c><00:01:44.479><c> so</c><00:01:44.720><c> we'll</c><00:01:45.040><c> see</c><00:01:45.759><c> here</c><00:01:46.079><c> as</c><00:01:46.320><c> you're</c>

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 align:start position:0%

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
the dip every time it went down because
 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.310 align:start position:0%
the dip every time it went down because
they've<00:01:58.479><c> been</c><00:01:58.920><c> pre-programmed</c><00:01:59.920><c> that</c>

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
they've been pre-programmed that
 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.389 align:start position:0%
they've been pre-programmed that

a<00:02:02.560><c> little</c><00:02:02.719><c> bit,</c><00:02:03.200><c> it's</c><00:02:03.520><c> time</c><00:02:03.680><c> to</c><00:02:03.840><c> buy</c><00:02:04.000><c> in.</c><00:02:04.399><c> Why?</c>

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit, it's time to buy in. Why?
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.709 align:start position:0%
a little bit, it's time to buy in. Why?
Because<00:02:04.799><c> they</c><00:02:05.040><c> look</c><00:02:05.200><c> at</c><00:02:05.360><c> those</c><00:02:05.520><c> YouTubers</c><00:02:06.399><c> who</c>

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
and they don't know when exactly to buy
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.390 align:start position:0%
and they don't know when exactly to buy
that.<00:02:13.440><c> They</c><00:02:13.680><c> have</c><00:02:13.840><c> no</c><00:02:14.080><c> intelligence</c><00:02:14.720><c> on</c><00:02:16.000><c> uh</c>

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
that. They have no intelligence on uh
 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.550 align:start position:0%
that. They have no intelligence on uh
you<00:02:16.560><c> know</c><00:02:16.640><c> when</c><00:02:16.959><c> that</c><00:02:17.200><c> right</c><00:02:17.440><c> moment</c><00:02:17.760><c> is</c><00:02:18.319><c> and</c>

you know when that right moment is and
 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.550 align:start position:0%
you know when that right moment is and
so<00:02:18.800><c> they</c><00:02:19.040><c> just</c><00:02:19.280><c> say</c><00:02:19.599><c> well</c><00:02:19.920><c> I'm</c><00:02:20.080><c> I'm</c><00:02:20.319><c> just</c><00:02:20.480><c> going</c>

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
mistake. Uh if you just watch the timing
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.510 align:start position:0%
mistake. Uh if you just watch the timing
just<00:02:27.599><c> a</c><00:02:27.840><c> little</c><00:02:28.000><c> bit</c><00:02:28.160><c> more.</c><00:02:28.560><c> I</c><00:02:29.120><c> covered</c><00:02:29.360><c> it</c>

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more. I covered it
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.790 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more. I covered it
many<00:02:29.840><c> times</c><00:02:30.000><c> before.</c><00:02:30.319><c> When</c><00:02:30.480><c> you</c><00:02:30.560><c> look</c><00:02:30.640><c> at</c>

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
many times before. When you look at
 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
many times before. When you look at
bowlinger<00:02:31.360><c> bands</c><00:02:31.680><c> when</c><00:02:31.840><c> you</c><00:02:31.920><c> look</c><00:02:32.000><c> at</c><00:02:32.160><c> like</c>

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
bowlinger bands when you look at like
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.790 align:start position:0%
bowlinger bands when you look at like
simple<00:02:32.720><c> metrics</c><00:02:33.519><c> it</c><00:02:33.760><c> gives</c><00:02:33.920><c> you</c><00:02:34.560><c> like</c><00:02:35.120><c> a</c><00:02:35.440><c> much</c>

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
simple metrics it gives you like a much
 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.030 align:start position:0%
simple metrics it gives you like a much
better<00:02:36.800><c> sense</c><00:02:37.599><c> of</c><00:02:37.920><c> what</c><00:02:38.080><c> to</c><00:02:38.239><c> do.</c><00:02:38.560><c> But</c><00:02:38.720><c> that's</c>

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
better sense of what to do. But that's
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.350 align:start position:0%
better sense of what to do. But that's
besides<00:02:39.440><c> the</c><00:02:39.680><c> point.</c><00:02:40.480><c> Look</c><00:02:40.640><c> at</c><00:02:40.800><c> it</c><00:02:41.120><c> right</c>

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
besides the point. Look at it right
 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.949 align:start position:0%
besides the point. Look at it right
here.<00:02:41.680><c> When</c><00:02:41.920><c> you</c><00:02:42.080><c> look</c><00:02:42.319><c> at</c><00:02:42.720><c> Nike</c><00:02:43.280><c> and</c>

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 align:start position:0%
here. When you look at Nike and
 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.949 align:start position:0%
here. When you look at Nike and
Lululemon,<00:02:44.959><c> well,</c><00:02:45.440><c> they</c><00:02:45.920><c> came</c><00:02:46.239><c> up</c><00:02:46.560><c> a</c><00:02:46.800><c> little</c>

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 align:start position:0%
Lululemon, well, they came up a little
 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.949 align:start position:0%
Lululemon, well, they came up a little
bit<00:02:47.440><c> because</c>

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
bit because
 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.350 align:start position:0%
bit because
um<00:02:49.200><c> Trump</c><00:02:49.599><c> had</c><00:02:49.840><c> the</c><00:02:50.239><c> call</c><00:02:50.480><c> with</c><00:02:51.040><c> the</c>

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
um Trump had the call with the
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.790 align:start position:0%
um Trump had the call with the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
Vietnamese leader
 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.150 align:start position:0%
Vietnamese leader
and<00:02:54.800><c> basically</c><00:02:55.120><c> it</c><00:02:55.360><c> was</c><00:02:55.519><c> productive</c>

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
and basically it was productive
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.750 align:start position:0%
and basically it was productive
supposedly.<00:02:56.879><c> So,</c><00:02:57.040><c> we</c><00:02:57.280><c> will</c><00:02:57.440><c> see</c><00:02:57.519><c> what</c>

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
supposedly. So, we will see what
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.550 align:start position:0%
supposedly. So, we will see what
happens.<00:02:58.239><c> If</c><00:02:58.720><c> more</c><00:02:59.200><c> countries</c><00:02:59.840><c> go</c><00:03:00.080><c> in</c><00:03:00.319><c> this</c>

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
happens. If more countries go in this
 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.869 align:start position:0%
happens. If more countries go in this
direction,<00:03:01.440><c> you</c><00:03:01.680><c> can</c><00:03:01.840><c> expect</c><00:03:02.159><c> a</c><00:03:02.400><c> bottoming</c>

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 align:start position:0%
direction, you can expect a bottoming
 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.670 align:start position:0%
direction, you can expect a bottoming
out<00:03:03.040><c> of</c><00:03:03.200><c> the</c><00:03:03.360><c> market</c><00:03:04.080><c> and</c><00:03:04.319><c> it</c><00:03:04.560><c> will</c><00:03:04.959><c> go</c><00:03:05.200><c> higher</c>

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
out of the market and it will go higher
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.390 align:start position:0%
out of the market and it will go higher

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
then increase your prices and you
 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.390 align:start position:0%
