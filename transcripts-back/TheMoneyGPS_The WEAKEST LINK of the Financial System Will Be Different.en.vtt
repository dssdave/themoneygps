that's<00:00:48.480><c> why</c><00:00:48.680><c> they</c><00:00:48.879><c> use</c><00:00:49.120><c> it</c><00:00:49.440><c> because</c><00:00:49.680><c> it's</c>

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's why they use it because it's
 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
that's why they use it because it's

the CPI and the pce so we also need to
pay<00:01:25.240><c> attention</c><00:01:25.640><c> so</c><00:01:25.799><c> that</c><00:01:25.960><c> we</c><00:01:26.079><c> could</c><00:01:26.280><c> stay</c>

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
pay attention so that we could stay

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
therefore inflation too high and so
