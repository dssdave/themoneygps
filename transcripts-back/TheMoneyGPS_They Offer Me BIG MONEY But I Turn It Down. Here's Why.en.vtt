00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
to do interviews most of the time I say
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
to do interviews most of the time I say
no<00:00:51.480><c> and</c><00:00:51.840><c> the</c><00:00:52.320><c> reason</c><00:00:52.649><c> I</c><00:00:52.860><c> do</c><00:00:53.520><c> this</c><00:00:53.550><c> is</c><00:00:53.789><c> because</c><00:00:54.120><c> I</c>

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 align:start position:0%
no and the reason I do this is because I
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 align:start position:0%
no and the reason I do this is because I
would<00:00:54.600><c> rather</c><00:00:54.899><c> do</c><00:00:55.379><c> videos</c><00:00:55.920><c> on</c><00:00:56.280><c> my</c><00:00:56.489><c> own</c><00:00:56.699><c> channel</c>

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
would rather do videos on my own channel
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.060 align:start position:0%
would rather do videos on my own channel
that<00:00:57.780><c> basically</c><00:00:58.140><c> takes</c><00:00:58.379><c> up</c><00:00:58.559><c> the</c><00:00:58.649><c> time</c><00:00:58.859><c> so</c>

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 align:start position:0%
that basically takes up the time so
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
that basically takes up the time so
instead<00:00:59.219><c> of</c><00:00:59.399><c> doing</c><00:00:59.670><c> one</c><00:01:00.210><c> YouTube</c><00:01:00.629><c> video</c><00:01:00.960><c> I</c>

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 align:start position:0%
instead of doing one YouTube video I
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.950 align:start position:0%
instead of doing one YouTube video I
would<00:01:01.440><c> have</c><00:01:01.620><c> to</c><00:01:01.710><c> do</c><00:01:01.859><c> the</c><00:01:02.550><c> interview</c><00:01:02.940><c> but</c><00:01:03.719><c> of</c>

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
would have to do the interview but of
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.539 align:start position:0%
would have to do the interview but of
