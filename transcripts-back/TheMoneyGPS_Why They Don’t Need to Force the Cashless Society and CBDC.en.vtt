um<00:12:07.680><c> but</c><00:12:07.839><c> anyway</c><00:12:08.600><c> the</c><00:12:08.760><c> point</c><00:12:09.440><c> is</c><00:12:10.440><c> this</c><00:12:10.600><c> is</c><00:12:11.480><c> we</c>

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
um but anyway the point is this is we
 

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
um but anyway the point is this is we
got<00:12:11.680><c> to</c><00:12:11.880><c> separate</c><00:12:12.440><c> fact</c><00:12:12.720><c> from</c><00:12:12.920><c> fiction</c><00:12:13.519><c> okay</c>

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
got to separate fact from fiction okay
 

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.189 align:start position:0%
got to separate fact from fiction okay
and<00:12:13.880><c> so</c><00:12:14.320><c> fed</c><00:12:14.680><c> now</c><00:12:15.079><c> it's</c><00:12:15.240><c> not</c><00:12:15.560><c> good</c><00:12:15.880><c> it's</c><00:12:16.000><c> the</c>

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
and so fed now it's not good it's the
