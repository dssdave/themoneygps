people start talking about oh thorium is
 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.029 align:start position:0%
people start talking about oh thorium is
better<00:04:49.479><c> than</c><00:04:50.000><c> uranium</c><00:04:51.000><c> yeah</c><00:04:51.520><c> for</c><00:04:51.680><c> a</c><00:04:51.800><c> lot</c><00:04:51.919><c> of</c>

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
better than uranium yeah for a lot of
 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.070 align:start position:0%
better than uranium yeah for a lot of
reasons<00:04:52.360><c> it</c><00:04:52.479><c> is</c><00:04:52.960><c> but</c><00:04:53.080><c> you</c><00:04:53.199><c> can't</c><00:04:53.400><c> make</c><00:04:53.600><c> a</c><00:04:53.759><c> nuke</c>

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
reasons it is but you can't make a nuke
 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.189 align:start position:0%
reasons it is but you can't make a nuke
out<00:04:54.199><c> of</c><00:04:54.360><c> it</c><00:04:55.160><c> and</c><00:04:55.600><c> so</c><00:04:56.440><c> guess</c><00:04:56.720><c> what's</c><00:04:56.919><c> going</c><00:04:57.039><c> to</c>

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
out of it and so guess what's going to
 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.350 align:start position:0%
out of it and so guess what's going to
take<00:04:57.440><c> off</c><00:04:58.440><c> that's</c><00:04:58.600><c> just</c><00:04:58.720><c> the</c><00:04:58.840><c> way</c><00:04:58.960><c> it</c><00:04:59.080><c> goes</c>

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
take off that's just the way it goes
 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
take off that's just the way it goes
okay<00:04:59.680><c> so</c><00:04:59.840><c> uranium</c><00:05:00.360><c> very</c><00:05:00.600><c> popular</c><00:05:01.000><c> I</c><00:05:01.120><c> was</c>

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.389 align:start position:0%
4,000 units and that went literally 4X
or<00:09:49.120><c> maybe</c><00:09:49.360><c> even</c><00:09:50.000><c> 5x</c><00:09:51.000><c> from</c><00:09:51.240><c> the</c><00:09:51.880><c> bottom</c><00:09:52.200><c> point</c>

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
so I was paying about 4 cents a unit and
 

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.710 align:start position:0%
so I was paying about 4 cents a unit and
then<00:09:55.720><c> we</c><00:09:55.920><c> got</c><00:09:56.120><c> to</c><00:09:56.480><c> let's</c><00:09:56.720><c> let's</c><00:09:56.839><c> just</c><00:09:57.000><c> say</c><00:09:57.200><c> 4X</c>

now<00:10:03.760><c> here's</c><00:10:04.040><c> the</c><00:10:04.240><c> thing</c><00:10:05.000><c> and</c><00:10:05.160><c> this</c><00:10:05.240><c> is</c><00:10:05.399><c> why</c>

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
now here's the thing and this is why
 

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.150 align:start position:0%
now here's the thing and this is why
inflation<00:10:06.000><c> is</c><00:10:06.600><c> tricky</c><00:10:07.600><c> so</c><00:10:07.839><c> 7</c><00:10:08.160><c> cents</c><00:10:08.399><c> a</c><00:10:08.560><c> unit</c>

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.870 align:start position:0%
interest and so on yeah the prices have
come<00:11:16.680><c> down</c><00:11:17.360><c> but</c><00:11:18.000><c> we</c><00:11:18.440><c> find</c><00:11:18.959><c> overall</c><00:11:19.600><c> that</c>

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
come down but we find overall that
 

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.590 align:start position:0%
come down but we find overall that
everything<00:11:20.320><c> is</c><00:11:20.519><c> unaffordable</c><00:11:21.440><c> and</c><00:11:21.680><c> that</c><00:11:21.880><c> is</c><00:11:22.040><c> a</c>

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
everything is unaffordable and that is a
 

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
everything is unaffordable and that is a
sign<00:11:23.160><c> that</c><00:11:23.360><c> the</c><00:11:23.639><c> economy</c><00:11:24.160><c> itself</c><00:11:24.760><c> is</c><00:11:25.120><c> weak</c>

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
sign that the economy itself is weak
 

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.710 align:start position:0%
sign that the economy itself is weak
it's<00:11:26.279><c> weak</c><00:11:27.279><c> and</c><00:11:27.399><c> so</c><00:11:27.720><c> the</c><00:11:27.920><c> expectation</c><00:11:28.480><c> here</c><00:11:28.600><c> is</c>

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's weak and so the expectation here is
 

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.990 align:start position:0%
it's weak and so the expectation here is
that<00:11:28.839><c> the</c><00:11:29.079><c> going</c><00:11:29.160><c> to</c><00:11:29.240><c> print</c><00:11:29.440><c> money</c><00:11:29.760><c> is</c><00:11:29.880><c> that</c>

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
that the going to print money is that
 

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.110 align:start position:0%
that the going to print money is that
