it's warmer I mean that's the climate is
 

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
it's warmer I mean that's the climate is

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.829 align:start position:0%

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
out that it's cooler but then the clouds
 

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.230 align:start position:0%
out that it's cooler but then the clouds
move<00:13:10.240><c> aside</c><00:13:10.839><c> and</c><00:13:10.959><c> then</c><00:13:11.120><c> it's</c>

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
move aside and then it's
 

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
move aside and then it's
warmer<00:13:13.240><c> so</c><00:13:13.480><c> I</c><00:13:13.680><c> guess</c><00:13:13.880><c> it's</c><00:13:14.480><c> like</c><00:13:14.639><c> a</c><00:13:14.880><c> climate</c>
