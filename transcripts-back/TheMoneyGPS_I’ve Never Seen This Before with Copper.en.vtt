00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.389 align:start position:0%
right let's open up a factory in
Cambodia<00:09:07.160><c> so</c><00:09:07.399><c> you</c><00:09:07.640><c> you</c><00:09:07.720><c> know</c><00:09:08.000><c> that's</c><00:09:08.240><c> what</c>

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
Cambodia so you you know that's what
 

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
Cambodia so you you know that's what
they're<00:09:08.600><c> doing</c><00:09:09.440><c> and</c><00:09:09.839><c> getting</c><00:09:10.160><c> around</c><00:09:10.399><c> the</c>

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're doing and getting around the
 

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.670 align:start position:0%
they're doing and getting around the
tariffs<00:09:11.120><c> at</c><00:09:11.240><c> the</c><00:09:11.360><c> same</c><00:09:11.640><c> time</c><00:09:12.399><c> so</c><00:09:12.560><c> they're</c>

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
tariffs at the same time so they're
 

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
tariffs at the same time so they're
going<00:09:12.800><c> to</c><00:09:12.880><c> have</c><00:09:13.040><c> higher</c><00:09:13.320><c> profit</c><00:09:13.560><c> margins</c>

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
going to have higher profit margins
 

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.750 align:start position:0%
going to have higher profit margins
probably<00:09:15.160><c> okay</c><00:09:15.720><c> so</c><00:09:16.240><c> I</c><00:09:16.360><c> think</c><00:09:16.519><c> that's</c>

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
probably okay so I think that's
 

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.389 align:start position:0%
probably okay so I think that's
important<00:09:17.120><c> just</c><00:09:17.240><c> to</c><00:09:17.680><c> understand</c><00:09:17.920><c> what's</c>

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
important just to understand what's
 

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:20.310 align:start position:0%
important just to understand what's
actually<00:09:18.920><c> happening</c><00:09:19.320><c> here</c><00:09:19.560><c> where</c><00:09:19.760><c> the</c><00:09:19.959><c> energy</c>

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
actually happening here where the energy
 

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.150 align:start position:0%
actually happening here where the energy

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
is coming from where the energy is going
 

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.750 align:start position:0%
is coming from where the energy is going
to<00:09:22.839><c> because</c><00:09:23.200><c> these</c><00:09:23.519><c> countries</c><00:09:24.000><c> are</c><00:09:24.200><c> the</c><00:09:24.360><c> ones</c>

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
to because these countries are the ones
 

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.550 align:start position:0%
to because these countries are the ones

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
that are going to need a lot of that
 

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.470 align:start position:0%
that are going to need a lot of that
energy<00:09:27.519><c> uh</c><00:09:27.640><c> and</c><00:09:27.760><c> we'll</c><00:09:27.920><c> see</c><00:09:28.120><c> how</c><00:09:28.320><c> that</c>

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
energy uh and we'll see how that
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.750 align:start position:0%
energy uh and we'll see how that
develops<00:09:29.440><c> over</c><00:09:29.640><c> the</c><00:09:29.760><c> next</c><00:09:29.959><c> little</c><00:09:30.200><c> while</c><00:09:30.600><c> here</c>

you<00:09:30.839><c> could</c><00:09:31.000><c> see</c><00:09:31.160><c> solar</c><00:09:31.839><c> for</c><00:09:32.040><c> example</c><00:09:32.440><c> we</c>

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
you could see solar for example we
 

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.910 align:start position:0%
you could see solar for example we
always<00:09:32.920><c> think</c><00:09:33.480><c> of</c><00:09:33.959><c> like</c><00:09:34.160><c> China</c><00:09:34.440><c> using</c><00:09:34.720><c> a</c><00:09:34.800><c> lot</c>

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
always think of like China using a lot
 

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.150 align:start position:0%
always think of like China using a lot
of<00:09:35.079><c> coal</c><00:09:35.839><c> and</c><00:09:36.000><c> so</c><00:09:36.200><c> on</c><00:09:36.480><c> certainly</c><00:09:37.160><c> they</c><00:09:37.399><c> do</c><00:09:38.040><c> uh</c>

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
of coal and so on certainly they do uh
 

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
of coal and so on certainly they do uh
they're<00:09:38.320><c> not</c><00:09:38.560><c> shy</c><00:09:39.200><c> from</c><00:09:39.480><c> that</c><00:09:39.800><c> but</c><00:09:40.040><c> you</c><00:09:40.240><c> you</c>

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
they're not shy from that but you you
 

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:45.509 align:start position:0%
they're not shy from that but you you
can<00:09:40.600><c> see</c><00:09:41.440><c> right</c><00:09:41.680><c> here</c><00:09:42.600><c> massively</c><00:09:43.519><c> China</c><00:09:44.000><c> has</c><00:09:45.000><c> a</c>

00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
can see right here massively China has a
 

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.110 align:start position:0%
can see right here massively China has a

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
us why Germany is choosing natural gas
 

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.310 align:start position:0%
us why Germany is choosing natural gas
over<00:09:53.480><c> nuclear</c><00:09:54.399><c> power</c><00:09:54.640><c> so</c><00:09:54.800><c> they're</c><00:09:54.920><c> shutting</c>

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
over nuclear power so they're shutting
 

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.069 align:start position:0%

00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
down their nuclear um and this is very
 

00:09:58.079 --> 00:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
down their nuclear um and this is very

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
of other places all right um I find it
 

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:05.990 align:start position:0%
of other places all right um I find it
