00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
think it was a little bit slow but in

think it was a little bit slow but in

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
the end they'll get it right because
 

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.389 align:start position:0%

look it's a list of items that you have
there<00:09:20.000><c> you</c><00:09:20.120><c> can</c><00:09:20.480><c> customize</c><00:09:21.240><c> that</c><00:09:21.640><c> just</c><00:09:21.839><c> like</c>

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
there you can customize that just like
