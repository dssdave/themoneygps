00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
asset classes and I talked a lot about
 

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
asset classes and I talked a lot about

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.870 align:start position:0%
diversity in within each of the asset
classes<00:16:58.040><c> I</c><00:16:58.160><c> believe</c><00:16:58.399><c> it</c><00:16:58.480><c> is</c><00:16:58.959><c> very</c><00:16:59.199><c> crucial</c><00:16:59.639><c> to</c>

00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.910 align:start position:0%
classes I believe it is very crucial to
not<00:17:00.199><c> just</c><00:17:00.480><c> own</c><00:17:01.000><c> one</c><00:17:01.560><c> asset</c><00:17:02.040><c> class</c><00:17:02.360><c> own</c><00:17:02.639><c> them</c>

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
not just own one asset class own them
 

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.870 align:start position:0%
not just own one asset class own them
all<00:17:03.319><c> there</c><00:17:03.440><c> are</c><00:17:03.720><c> so</c><00:17:03.920><c> many</c><00:17:04.280><c> more</c><00:17:04.839><c> things</c><00:17:05.720><c> that</c>

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
all there are so many more things that
 

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.630 align:start position:0%
all there are so many more things that
you<00:17:06.000><c> could</c><00:17:06.199><c> own</c><00:17:06.520><c> here</c><00:17:06.679><c> I</c><00:17:06.880><c> just</c><00:17:07.039><c> discussed</c><00:17:07.520><c> the</c>

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
you could own here I just discussed the
 

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.789 align:start position:0%
you could own here I just discussed the
four<00:17:08.039><c> basics</c><00:17:08.959><c> that</c><00:17:09.120><c> I</c><00:17:09.240><c> do</c><00:17:09.559><c> so</c><00:17:10.039><c> uh</c><00:17:10.160><c> in</c><00:17:10.280><c> my</c><00:17:10.480><c> book</c>

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
four basics that I do so uh in my book
 

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:12.750 align:start position:0%
four basics that I do so uh in my book
so<00:17:10.959><c> I</c><00:17:11.039><c> wanted</c><00:17:11.280><c> to</c><00:17:11.480><c> keep</c><00:17:11.640><c> it</c><00:17:12.039><c> all</c><00:17:12.280><c> part</c><00:17:12.439><c> of</c><00:17:12.559><c> the</c>

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to keep it all part of the
 

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.750 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to keep it all part of the
theme<00:17:13.160><c> Here</c><00:17:13.640><c> I</c><00:17:13.720><c> believe</c><00:17:13.959><c> it's</c><00:17:14.160><c> very</c><00:17:14.360><c> important</c>

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
theme Here I believe it's very important
 

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.669 align:start position:0%
theme Here I believe it's very important
to<00:17:15.240><c> really</c><00:17:16.079><c> be</c><00:17:16.280><c> able</c><00:17:16.520><c> to</c><00:17:17.079><c> understand</c><00:17:17.400><c> each</c>

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
to really be able to understand each
 

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
to really be able to understand each
asset<00:17:18.199><c> class</c><00:17:18.880><c> and</c><00:17:19.160><c> how</c><00:17:19.400><c> to</c><00:17:20.000><c> uh</c><00:17:20.240><c> decide</c><00:17:20.799><c> what</c><00:17:20.919><c> is</c>

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
asset class and how to uh decide what is
 

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.029 align:start position:0%
asset class and how to uh decide what is
best<00:17:21.319><c> for</c><00:17:21.480><c> you</c><00:17:21.679><c> in</c><00:17:21.760><c> terms</c><00:17:22.000><c> of</c><00:17:22.240><c> percentages</c><00:17:22.880><c> and</c>

00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
best for you in terms of percentages and
 

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:26.069 align:start position:0%
best for you in terms of percentages and
everything<00:17:23.319><c> else</c><00:17:23.679><c> that</c><00:17:23.880><c> changes</c><00:17:24.880><c> over</c><00:17:25.319><c> time</c>

everything else that changes over time
 

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.750 align:start position:0%
everything else that changes over time
right<00:17:26.280><c> now</c><00:17:26.480><c> you</c><00:17:26.640><c> may</c><00:17:26.799><c> want</c><00:17:27.039><c> more</c><00:17:27.240><c> Safety</c><00:17:27.559><c> and</c>

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
right now you may want more Safety and
 

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.110 align:start position:0%
right now you may want more Safety and
Security<00:17:28.199><c> you</c><00:17:28.280><c> may</c><00:17:28.439><c> feel</c><00:17:29.000><c> that</c><00:17:29.600><c> uh</c><00:17:29.760><c> precious</c>

metals are at a cheap value so you would
 

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.710 align:start position:0%
metals are at a cheap value so you would

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
go overweight in those and then if they
 

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.630 align:start position:0%
go overweight in those and then if they
