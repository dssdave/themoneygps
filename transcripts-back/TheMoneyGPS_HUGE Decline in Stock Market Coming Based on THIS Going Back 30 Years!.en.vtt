00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
Russell 2000 so we're getting a broad
 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
Russell 2000 so we're getting a broad

seasonally a decline we are talking
 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.750 align:start position:0%
seasonally a decline we are talking
about<00:00:46.039><c> from</c><00:00:46.640><c> July</c><00:00:47.640><c> to</c><00:00:48.079><c> October</c><00:00:49.079><c> we</c><00:00:49.280><c> tend</c><00:00:49.559><c> to</c>

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
about from July to October we tend to
 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.389 align:start position:0%
about from July to October we tend to
see<00:00:50.120><c> a</c><00:00:50.440><c> period</c><00:00:51.120><c> of</c>

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
see a period of
 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.709 align:start position:0%
see a period of

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
weakness and potential declines that's
 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.029 align:start position:0%
weakness and potential declines that's
just<00:00:57.480><c> going</c><00:00:57.920><c> back</c><00:00:58.800><c> 30</c><00:00:59.280><c> years</c><00:01:00.280><c> this</c><00:01:00.480><c> does</c><00:01:01.039><c> not</c>
