00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
and therefore you know let's take it
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
and therefore you know let's take it
back<00:04:21.720><c> a</c><00:04:21.959><c> notch</c><00:04:22.639><c> and</c><00:04:22.800><c> that's</c><00:04:22.960><c> what</c><00:04:23.160><c> could</c>

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.390 align:start position:0%
back a notch and that's what could
happen<00:04:24.360><c> like</c><00:04:24.560><c> I</c><00:04:24.680><c> said</c><00:04:25.479><c> could</c><00:04:25.680><c> reverse</c><00:04:26.160><c> I</c><00:04:26.240><c> don't</c>

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
