is<00:04:51.160><c> just</c><00:04:51.320><c> the</c><00:04:51.520><c> calls</c><00:04:52.080><c> so</c><00:04:52.240><c> you</c><00:04:52.320><c> could</c><00:04:52.479><c> see</c><00:04:52.720><c> that</c>

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
is just the calls so you could see that
 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.749 align:start position:0%
is just the calls so you could see that
overwhelmingly<00:04:53.759><c> the</c><00:04:53.880><c> bias</c><00:04:54.400><c> is</c><00:04:55.199><c> on</c><00:04:55.320><c> the</c><00:04:55.520><c> upside</c>

have to buy during this time at the end
 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.110 align:start position:0%
have to buy during this time at the end
of<00:05:16.600><c> each</c><00:05:16.800><c> quarter</c><00:05:17.639><c> but</c><00:05:17.919><c> also</c><00:05:18.319><c> big</c><00:05:18.600><c> time</c><00:05:18.919><c> at</c><00:05:19.039><c> the</c>

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
end of the year and so there's a desire
 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.590 align:start position:0%
end of the year and so there's a desire
to<00:05:23.120><c> to</c><00:05:23.319><c> buy</c><00:05:24.039><c> so</c><00:05:24.560><c> that</c><00:05:24.840><c> that</c><00:05:24.960><c> tends</c><00:05:25.240><c> to</c><00:05:25.360><c> be</c><00:05:25.479><c> the</c>

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
to to buy so that that tends to be the
 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
to to buy so that that tends to be the
bias<00:05:26.000><c> and</c><00:05:26.280><c> that</c><00:05:26.520><c> is</c><00:05:26.800><c> one</c><00:05:26.960><c> of</c><00:05:27.120><c> the</c><00:05:27.360><c> reasons</c><00:05:28.360><c> why</c>

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
bias and that is one of the reasons why
 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.390 align:start position:0%
bias and that is one of the reasons why
towards<00:05:28.919><c> the</c><00:05:29.000><c> end</c><00:05:29.160><c> of</c><00:05:29.240><c> the</c><00:05:29.319><c> year</c><00:05:29.600><c> here</c><00:05:30.199><c> that</c>

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the year here that
 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.749 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the year here that
there<00:05:30.840><c> generally</c><00:05:31.400><c> is</c><00:05:31.520><c> a</c><00:05:31.680><c> rally</c><00:05:32.080><c> like</c><00:05:32.199><c> I</c><00:05:32.360><c> said</c>

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
there generally is a rally like I said
 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.150 align:start position:0%
there generally is a rally like I said
if<00:05:32.919><c> there</c><00:05:33.120><c> was</c><00:05:33.360><c> this</c><00:05:33.680><c> massive</c><00:05:34.120><c> recession</c><00:05:34.919><c> and</c>

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
if there was this massive recession and
 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
if there was this massive recession and
like<00:05:35.319><c> millions</c><00:05:35.720><c> of</c><00:05:35.840><c> people</c><00:05:36.039><c> were</c><00:05:36.199><c> being</c><00:05:36.400><c> laid</c>

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
like millions of people were being laid
 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.230 align:start position:0%
like millions of people were being laid

off suddenly tomorrow that changes
 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.110 align:start position:0%
off suddenly tomorrow that changes
things<00:05:40.000><c> but</c><00:05:40.160><c> just</c><00:05:40.360><c> in</c><00:05:40.520><c> general</c><00:05:40.840><c> these</c><00:05:40.960><c> are</c>

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
things but just in general these are
 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.990 align:start position:0%
things but just in general these are
generalizations<00:05:42.080><c> okay</c><00:05:42.800><c> and</c><00:05:43.039><c> look</c><00:05:43.479><c> more</c><00:05:43.800><c> of</c>

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
generalizations okay and look more of
 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.430 align:start position:0%
generalizations okay and look more of
that<00:05:44.199><c> you</c><00:05:44.319><c> can</c><00:05:44.479><c> see</c><00:05:44.840><c> European</c><00:05:45.520><c> market</c><00:05:45.840><c> bre</c>

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
that you can see European market bre
 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.469 align:start position:0%
that you can see European market bre
heads<00:05:46.880><c> towards</c><00:05:47.600><c> resistance</c><00:05:48.199><c> levels</c><00:05:49.160><c> and</c>

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
heads towards resistance levels and
 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.909 align:start position:0%
heads towards resistance levels and
that's<00:05:49.639><c> generally</c><00:05:50.039><c> the</c><00:05:50.120><c> way</c><00:05:50.280><c> this</c><00:05:50.400><c> works</c><00:05:50.720><c> okay</c>

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 align:start position:0%
that's generally the way this works okay
 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.870 align:start position:0%
that's generally the way this works okay
