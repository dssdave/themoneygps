00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.110 align:start position:0%
everything you need to know right here
let's<00:00:52.840><c> begin</c><00:00:53.719><c> what</c><00:00:53.960><c> we're</c><00:00:54.160><c> looking</c><00:00:54.440><c> at</c><00:00:54.840><c> right</c>

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
let's begin what we're looking at right
 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.670 align:start position:0%
let's begin what we're looking at right
now<00:00:55.440><c> in</c><00:00:55.640><c> this</c><00:00:55.920><c> video</c><00:00:56.640><c> is</c><00:00:57.039><c> an</c><00:00:57.320><c> analysis</c><00:00:58.320><c> that</c><00:00:58.480><c> I</c>

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
now in this video is an analysis that I
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.110 align:start position:0%
now in this video is an analysis that I
did<00:00:59.320><c> providing</c><00:00:59.719><c> some</c><00:00:59.960><c> some</c><00:01:00.199><c> information</c><00:01:00.879><c> to</c>

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
did providing some some information to
 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.429 align:start position:0%
did providing some some information to
the<00:01:01.320><c> GPT</c><00:01:02.280><c> that</c><00:01:02.559><c> I've</c><00:01:03.040><c> created</c><00:01:04.040><c> so</c><00:01:04.439><c> this</c><00:01:04.960><c> looks</c>

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
the GPT that I've created so this looks
 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.149 align:start position:0%
the GPT that I've created so this looks
up<00:01:06.159><c> all</c><00:01:06.799><c> past</c><00:01:07.520><c> cycles</c><00:01:08.520><c> and</c><00:01:08.880><c> Compares</c><00:01:09.560><c> that</c><00:01:09.799><c> to</c>

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
up all past cycles and Compares that to
 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.230 align:start position:0%
up all past cycles and Compares that to
current<00:01:10.799><c> data</c><00:01:11.640><c> and</c><00:01:11.759><c> so</c><00:01:12.159><c> when</c><00:01:12.360><c> I</c><00:01:12.600><c> do</c><00:01:12.880><c> this</c><00:01:13.080><c> it's</c>

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
current data and so when I do this it's
 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
current data and so when I do this it's
a<00:01:13.320><c> lot</c><00:01:13.479><c> more</c><00:01:13.680><c> complicated</c><00:01:14.200><c> than</c><00:01:14.439><c> that</c><00:01:14.720><c> but</c>

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
a lot more complicated than that but
 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.429 align:start position:0%
a lot more complicated than that but
essentially<00:01:15.520><c> when</c><00:01:15.640><c> I</c><00:01:15.880><c> do</c><00:01:16.240><c> this</c><00:01:16.799><c> it</c><00:01:17.000><c> provides</c>

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
essentially when I do this it provides
 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.310 align:start position:0%
essentially when I do this it provides
me<00:01:17.720><c> with</c><00:01:17.960><c> a</c><00:01:18.200><c> report</c><00:01:19.000><c> the</c><00:01:19.200><c> people</c><00:01:19.680><c> that</c><00:01:19.920><c> have</c>
