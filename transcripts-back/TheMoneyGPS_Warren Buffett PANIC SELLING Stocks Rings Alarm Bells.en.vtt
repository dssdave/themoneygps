all that nonsense okay so let's I mean I
 

00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:29.470 align:start position:0%
all that nonsense okay so let's I mean I
I<00:09:26.959><c> still</c><00:09:27.240><c> can't</c><00:09:27.480><c> say</c><00:09:27.680><c> that</c><00:09:27.839><c> without</c><00:09:28.120><c> laughing</c>

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
I still can't say that without laughing
