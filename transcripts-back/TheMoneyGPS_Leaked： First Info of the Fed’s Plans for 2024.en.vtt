00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
more than it goes down the difference
 

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.829 align:start position:0%
more than it goes down the difference
here<00:09:28.800><c> is</c><00:09:28.920><c> that</c>

00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
here is that
 

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:34.870 align:start position:0%
here is that
the<00:09:30.279><c> down</c><00:09:31.279><c> is</c><00:09:31.920><c> very</c><00:09:32.519><c> fast</c><00:09:33.160><c> and</c><00:09:33.519><c> very</c><00:09:33.920><c> painful</c>

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
the down is very fast and very painful
 

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.910 align:start position:0%
the down is very fast and very painful
so<00:09:35.200><c> it</c><00:09:35.320><c> you</c><00:09:35.399><c> know</c><00:09:35.640><c> kind</c><00:09:35.760><c> of</c><00:09:35.880><c> goes</c><00:09:36.160><c> slowly</c><00:09:36.720><c> on</c>

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
so it you know kind of goes slowly on
 

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.630 align:start position:0%
so it you know kind of goes slowly on
the<00:09:37.040><c> way</c><00:09:37.360><c> up</c><00:09:37.839><c> but</c><00:09:37.959><c> when</c><00:09:38.079><c> it</c><00:09:38.200><c> goes</c><00:09:38.480><c> down</c><00:09:38.839><c> it</c><00:09:39.079><c> hits</c>

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
the way up but when it goes down it hits
 

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.790 align:start position:0%
the way up but when it goes down it hits
hard<00:09:40.040><c> it</c><00:09:40.279><c> raises</c><00:09:41.240><c> a</c><00:09:41.399><c> lot</c><00:09:41.519><c> of</c><00:09:41.720><c> gains</c><00:09:42.560><c> uh</c><00:09:42.680><c> that</c>

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
hard it raises a lot of gains uh that
 

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.509 align:start position:0%
