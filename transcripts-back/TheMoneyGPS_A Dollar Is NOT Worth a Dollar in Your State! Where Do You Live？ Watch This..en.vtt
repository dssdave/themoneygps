so let me unveil that for you let's look
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.189 align:start position:0%
so let me unveil that for you let's look
at<00:00:25.980><c> this</c><00:00:26.250><c> graphic</c><00:00:26.789><c> right</c><00:00:27.029><c> away</c><00:00:27.330><c> what</c><00:00:27.930><c> we</c><00:00:28.050><c> can</c>

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
at this graphic right away what we can
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
at this graphic right away what we can
see<00:00:28.410><c> here</c><00:00:28.800><c> is</c><00:00:30.650><c> $100</c><00:00:31.650><c> what</c><00:00:31.980><c> is</c><00:00:32.160><c> the</c><00:00:32.399><c> value</c><00:00:33.059><c> of</c>

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 align:start position:0%
see here is $100 what is the value of
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
see here is $100 what is the value of
that<00:00:33.450><c> you</c><00:00:33.630><c> know</c><00:00:33.750><c> you</c><00:00:33.809><c> see</c><00:00:34.110><c> the</c><00:00:34.290><c> numbers</c><00:00:34.760><c> 100</c>

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
that you know you see the numbers 100
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
that you know you see the numbers 100
but<00:00:36.270><c> what</c><00:00:36.510><c> does</c><00:00:36.750><c> that</c><00:00:36.780><c> mean</c><00:00:37.610><c> well</c><00:00:38.610><c> looking</c><00:00:38.940><c> at</c>

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 align:start position:0%
but what does that mean well looking at
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.549 align:start position:0%
but what does that mean well looking at
this<00:00:39.239><c> chart</c><00:00:39.629><c> you</c><00:00:40.170><c> can</c><00:00:40.410><c> see</c><00:00:40.879><c> based</c><00:00:41.879><c> on</c><00:00:42.120><c> the</c><00:00:43.079><c> US</c>

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
this chart you can see based on the US
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 align:start position:0%
this chart you can see based on the US
different<00:00:44.489><c> states</c><00:00:44.910><c> you'll</c><00:00:45.719><c> see</c><00:00:45.960><c> what</c><00:00:46.200><c> that</c>

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 align:start position:0%
different states you'll see what that
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.299 align:start position:0%
different states you'll see what that
value<00:00:46.620><c> is</c>

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 align:start position:0%
value is
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.869 align:start position:0%
value is
now<00:00:47.910><c> the</c><00:00:47.969><c> darker</c><00:00:48.629><c> the</c><00:00:48.750><c> color</c><00:00:48.780><c> the</c><00:00:49.230><c> more</c><00:00:49.879><c> value</c>

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
now the darker the color the more value
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.450 align:start position:0%
now the darker the color the more value
you<00:00:50.910><c> get</c><00:00:51.270><c> for</c><00:00:51.449><c> your</c><00:00:51.539><c> money</c><00:00:51.780><c> and</c><00:00:51.989><c> obviously</c><00:00:52.860><c> the</c>

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
you get for your money and obviously the
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
you get for your money and obviously the
more<00:00:53.670><c> yellow</c><00:00:53.969><c> the</c><00:00:54.300><c> color</c><00:00:54.510><c> then</c><00:00:55.170><c> it</c><00:00:55.530><c> is</c><00:00:55.860><c> the</c>

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 align:start position:0%
more yellow the color then it is the
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.770 align:start position:0%
more yellow the color then it is the
least<00:00:56.610><c> value</c><00:00:57.120><c> so</c><00:00:57.270><c> you</c><00:00:57.360><c> can</c><00:00:57.480><c> see</c><00:00:57.600><c> that</c>

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
least value so you can see that
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.189 align:start position:0%
least value so you can see that
California<00:00:58.680><c> for</c><00:00:58.890><c> example</c><00:00:59.489><c> you</c><00:01:00.149><c> have</c><00:01:00.420><c> 88</c>

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
California for example you have 88
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.810 align:start position:0%
California for example you have 88
dollars<00:01:02.010><c> and</c><00:01:02.420><c> an</c><00:01:03.420><c> area</c><00:01:03.750><c> like</c><00:01:04.080><c> for</c><00:01:04.559><c> example</c>

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 align:start position:0%
dollars and an area like for example
 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
dollars and an area like for example
Kentucky<00:01:05.820><c> you</c><00:01:06.540><c> get</c><00:01:06.720><c> a</c><00:01:06.750><c> hundred</c><00:01:07.080><c> and</c><00:01:07.200><c> thirteen</c>

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 align:start position:0%
Kentucky you get a hundred and thirteen
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
Kentucky you get a hundred and thirteen
dollars<00:01:08.159><c> so</c><00:01:08.729><c> your</c><00:01:08.909><c> money</c><00:01:09.270><c> goes</c><00:01:09.630><c> a</c><00:01:09.659><c> lot</c><00:01:09.990><c> further</c>

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 align:start position:0%
dollars so your money goes a lot further
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.679 align:start position:0%
dollars so your money goes a lot further
in<00:01:10.799><c> Kentucky</c><00:01:11.310><c> than</c><00:01:11.460><c> it</c><00:01:11.580><c> does</c><00:01:11.729><c> in</c><00:01:11.880><c> California</c>

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 align:start position:0%
in Kentucky than it does in California
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.690 align:start position:0%
in Kentucky than it does in California
that's<00:01:13.350><c> essentially</c><00:01:13.770><c> what</c><00:01:13.799><c> this</c><00:01:14.130><c> graphic</c><00:01:14.400><c> is</c>

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's essentially what this graphic is
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.090 align:start position:0%
that's essentially what this graphic is
