00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
part all you need to understand is that
 

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:29.910 align:start position:0%
part all you need to understand is that
it's<00:13:28.240><c> liquidity</c><00:13:29.079><c> and</c><00:13:29.240><c> we</c><00:13:29.399><c> measure</c><00:13:29.800><c> that</c>

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's liquidity and we measure that
 

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
it's liquidity and we measure that
through<00:13:30.160><c> different</c><00:13:30.600><c> ways</c><00:13:31.600><c> and</c><00:13:31.800><c> so</c><00:13:32.639><c> um</c><00:13:33.079><c> it's</c>

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
through different ways and so um it's
 

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
through different ways and so um it's
very<00:13:33.639><c> complicated</c><00:13:34.120><c> certainly</c><00:13:34.639><c> but</c><00:13:34.800><c> the</c><00:13:34.920><c> point</c>

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
very complicated certainly but the point
 

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:37.389 align:start position:0%
very complicated certainly but the point
is<00:13:35.560><c> when</c><00:13:35.720><c> there's</c><00:13:36.279><c> not</c><00:13:36.480><c> enough</c><00:13:36.800><c> liquidity</c><00:13:37.320><c> you</c>

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
is when there's not enough liquidity you
 

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.389 align:start position:0%
is when there's not enough liquidity you
could<00:13:37.519><c> see</c><00:13:37.639><c> the</c><00:13:37.800><c> markets</c><00:13:38.120><c> coming</c><00:13:38.399><c> down</c><00:13:39.240><c> that's</c>
