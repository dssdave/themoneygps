00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell from this chart but
 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.630 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell from this chart but
we're<00:04:01.840><c> looking</c><00:04:02.159><c> at</c><00:04:02.480><c> for</c><00:04:02.680><c> the</c><00:04:02.879><c> last</c><00:04:03.120><c> year</c><00:04:03.319><c> and</c><00:04:03.480><c> a</c>

we're looking at for the last year and a

we're looking at for the last year and a

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
bit we are seeing that there hasn't been
 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.869 align:start position:0%
bit we are seeing that there hasn't been

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
much movement in those so I believe that
 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
much movement in those so I believe that
