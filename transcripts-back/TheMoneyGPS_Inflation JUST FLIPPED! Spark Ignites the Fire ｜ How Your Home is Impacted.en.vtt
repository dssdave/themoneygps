favorable year-over-year effect is over
so<00:00:51.059><c> remember</c><00:00:51.360><c> where</c><00:00:51.960><c> we</c><00:00:52.260><c> were</c><00:00:53.120><c> 2021</c><00:00:54.120><c> that</c><00:00:54.660><c> ends</c>

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
so remember where we were 2021 that ends
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010 align:start position:0%
so remember where we were 2021 that ends
of<00:00:55.140><c> 2022</c><00:00:55.800><c> inflation</c><00:00:56.520><c> was</c><00:00:56.820><c> going</c><00:00:57.120><c> straight</c><00:00:57.719><c> up</c>

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
of 2022 inflation was going straight up
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
of 2022 inflation was going straight up
now<00:00:58.860><c> that</c><00:00:59.219><c> became</c><00:00:59.579><c> a</c><00:00:59.940><c> issue</c><00:01:00.660><c> suddenly</c><00:01:01.260><c> because</c>

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
now that became a issue suddenly because
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.609 align:start position:0%
now that became a issue suddenly because
we<00:01:02.100><c> were</c><00:01:02.280><c> at</c><00:01:02.699><c> basically</c><00:01:03.239><c> no</c><00:01:03.780><c> inflation</c><00:01:04.260><c> or</c>

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
we were at basically no inflation or
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
we were at basically no inflation or
negative<00:01:05.040><c> inflation</c><00:01:05.640><c> in</c><00:01:06.119><c> the</c><00:01:06.360><c> way</c><00:01:06.479><c> that</c><00:01:06.659><c> they</c>

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
negative inflation in the way that they
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
negative inflation in the way that they
show<00:01:07.140><c> it</c><00:01:07.380><c> and</c><00:01:07.619><c> suddenly</c><00:01:08.100><c> it's</c><00:01:08.340><c> going</c><00:01:08.580><c> up</c><00:01:08.820><c> so</c>

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
show it and suddenly it's going up so
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
show it and suddenly it's going up so
that<00:01:09.600><c> year</c><00:01:09.900><c> over</c><00:01:10.080><c> year</c><00:01:10.439><c> stat</c><00:01:10.799><c> is</c><00:01:11.159><c> really</c>

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
that year over year stat is really
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.330 align:start position:0%
that year over year stat is really
skewed<00:01:12.000><c> but</c><00:01:12.240><c> on</c><00:01:12.420><c> the</c><00:01:12.540><c> way</c><00:01:12.659><c> down</c><00:01:13.020><c> it</c><00:01:13.860><c> works</c><00:01:14.220><c> in</c>

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
skewed but on the way down it works in
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 align:start position:0%

this<00:01:14.520><c> way</c><00:01:14.700><c> where</c><00:01:15.000><c> hey</c><00:01:15.360><c> everything's</c><00:01:16.020><c> doing</c>

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
this way where hey everything's doing
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.950 align:start position:0%
this way where hey everything's doing
better<00:01:16.560><c> but</c><00:01:17.340><c> now</c><00:01:17.640><c> we</c><00:01:17.880><c> are</c><00:01:18.000><c> at</c><00:01:18.180><c> that</c><00:01:18.360><c> inflection</c>

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 align:start position:0%

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.830 align:start position:0%

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
looking at it this is the CPI core
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.969 align:start position:0%
looking at it this is the CPI core

Services less shelter okay because a
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 align:start position:0%

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
shelter has to be right now the biggest

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
component of this and so you will see
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.130 align:start position:0%
component of this and so you will see
that<00:01:37.259><c> having</c><00:01:38.040><c> such</c><00:01:38.460><c> an</c><00:01:38.640><c> impact</c><00:01:38.939><c> even</c><00:01:39.780><c> though</c>

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
um you know the money supply they go in
 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.309 align:start position:0%
um you know the money supply they go in
hand<00:06:59.819><c> in</c><00:07:00.000><c> hand</c><00:07:00.180><c> there's</c><00:07:00.539><c> a</c><00:07:00.780><c> lot</c><00:07:00.900><c> of</c><00:07:01.080><c> different</c>

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
hand in hand there's a lot of different
 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.710 align:start position:0%
hand in hand there's a lot of different
ways<00:07:01.919><c> to</c><00:07:02.220><c> measure</c><00:07:02.580><c> money</c><00:07:03.000><c> and</c><00:07:03.360><c> currency</c>

ways to measure money and currency
 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.590 align:start position:0%
ways to measure money and currency
there's<00:07:04.500><c> a</c><00:07:04.680><c> lot</c><00:07:04.800><c> there</c><00:07:05.039><c> but</c><00:07:05.819><c> this</c><00:07:06.120><c> is</c><00:07:06.240><c> just</c><00:07:06.360><c> one</c>

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there but this is just one
 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there but this is just one
way<00:07:06.720><c> M2</c><00:07:07.380><c> and</c><00:07:08.280><c> that's</c><00:07:08.699><c> money</c><00:07:09.000><c> in</c><00:07:09.240><c> circulation</c>

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
way M2 and that's money in circulation
 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.909 align:start position:0%
way M2 and that's money in circulation
so<00:07:10.740><c> we</c><00:07:11.100><c> can</c><00:07:11.220><c> see</c><00:07:11.400><c> that</c><00:07:11.699><c> over</c><00:07:12.180><c> time</c><00:07:12.600><c> if</c><00:07:13.380><c> we</c><00:07:13.680><c> are</c>

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.550 align:start position:0%
