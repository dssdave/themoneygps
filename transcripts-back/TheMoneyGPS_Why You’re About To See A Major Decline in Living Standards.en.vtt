so it's moving higher and in the case of
Canada<00:01:51.159><c> you</c><00:01:51.280><c> could</c><00:01:51.439><c> see</c><00:01:51.600><c> the</c><00:01:51.719><c> changes</c><00:01:52.119><c> that</c>

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
Canada you could see the changes that
 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.350 align:start position:0%
Canada you could see the changes that
they<00:01:52.479><c> made</c><00:01:53.280><c> so</c><00:01:53.479><c> basically</c><00:01:53.880><c> the</c><00:01:54.159><c> capital</c><00:01:54.520><c> gains</c>

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
they made so basically the capital gains
 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.990 align:start position:0%
they made so basically the capital gains
inclusion<00:01:56.240><c> rate</c><00:01:57.159><c> so</c><00:01:58.039><c> just</c><00:01:58.280><c> think</c><00:01:58.439><c> of</c><00:01:58.680><c> this</c>

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
inclusion rate so just think of this
 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.469 align:start position:0%
inclusion rate so just think of this
like

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
like
you<00:02:00.640><c> know</c><00:02:01.479><c> previously</c><00:02:02.119><c> if</c><00:02:02.240><c> you</c><00:02:02.360><c> were</c><00:02:02.680><c> going</c><00:02:03.079><c> to</c>

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know previously if you were going to
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.310 align:start position:0%
you know previously if you were going to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh have to pay your capital gains it
 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.990 align:start position:0%
uh have to pay your capital gains it
