and now that has really changed that has
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.350 align:start position:0%
and now that has really changed that has
started<00:03:30.159><c> to</c><00:03:30.439><c> come</c><00:03:30.720><c> down</c><00:03:30.959><c> and</c><00:03:31.200><c> Powell</c><00:03:32.000><c> was</c>

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
started to come down and Powell was
 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.710 align:start position:0%
started to come down and Powell was
asked<00:03:32.760><c> about</c><00:03:33.040><c> this</c><00:03:33.280><c> mentioned</c><00:03:33.840><c> this</c><00:03:34.680><c> and</c><00:03:34.799><c> so</c><00:03:35.560><c> I</c>

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
asked about this mentioned this and so I
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.149 align:start position:0%
asked about this mentioned this and so I
think<00:03:35.920><c> it</c><00:03:36.040><c> is</c><00:03:36.280><c> extremely</c><00:03:36.840><c> important</c><00:03:37.560><c> to</c><00:03:37.840><c> break</c>

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
think it is extremely important to break
 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.110 align:start position:0%
think it is extremely important to break
that<00:03:38.360><c> down</c><00:03:39.040><c> right</c><00:03:39.280><c> here</c><00:03:39.599><c> and</c><00:03:39.920><c> now</c><00:03:40.920><c> the</c>

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
that down right here and now the
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.429 align:start position:0%
that down right here and now the
question<00:03:41.480><c> is</c><00:03:42.239><c> you</c><00:03:42.360><c> know</c><00:03:42.760><c> she</c><00:03:42.959><c> goes</c><00:03:43.159><c> on</c><00:03:43.319><c> and</c>

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
question is you know she goes on and
 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.830 align:start position:0%
question is you know she goes on and
says<00:03:43.599><c> a</c><00:03:43.680><c> few</c><00:03:43.879><c> things</c><00:03:44.120><c> but</c><00:03:44.439><c> has</c><00:03:44.640><c> there</c><00:03:44.959><c> been</c><00:03:45.360><c> any</c>
