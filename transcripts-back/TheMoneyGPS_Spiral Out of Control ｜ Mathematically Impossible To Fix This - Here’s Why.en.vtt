00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
that they have so much of the market and

that they have so much of the market and

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
we can and at this time we don't want to
 

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.090 align:start position:0%
we can and at this time we don't want to

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
so we want to have the balance and what
 

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.370 align:start position:0%
so we want to have the balance and what
I<00:12:31.620><c> mean</c><00:12:31.740><c> by</c><00:12:31.860><c> that</c><00:12:32.100><c> is</c><00:12:32.279><c> essentially</c><00:12:32.820><c> looking</c><00:12:33.779><c> at</c>

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
I mean by that is essentially looking at
