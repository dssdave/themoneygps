looking at this uh Nvidia is just

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly I mean just going crazy
 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.910 align:start position:0%

but<00:10:55.000><c> what</c><00:10:55.160><c> I</c><00:10:55.279><c> think</c><00:10:55.440><c> is</c><00:10:55.680><c> important</c><00:10:56.519><c> right</c><00:10:56.760><c> here</c>

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
but what I think is important right here
 

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.509 align:start position:0%
but what I think is important right here
and<00:10:57.160><c> now</c><00:10:57.519><c> is</c><00:10:57.639><c> to</c><00:10:57.839><c> look</c><00:10:58.040><c> at</c><00:10:58.279><c> Intel</c><00:10:59.000><c> they</c><00:10:59.320><c> have</c>

00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
and now is to look at Intel they have
 

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
and now is to look at Intel they have

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.910 align:start position:0%
performed poorly and since this chart
was<00:11:03.800><c> created</c>

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
was created
 

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.430 align:start position:0%

actually
 

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.910 align:start position:0%
actually
