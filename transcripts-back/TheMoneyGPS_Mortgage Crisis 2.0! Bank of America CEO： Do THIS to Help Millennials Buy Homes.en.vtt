00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.069 align:start position:0%
CEO. So our goal
is<00:00:44.320><c> should</c><00:00:44.719><c> you</c><00:00:44.960><c> move</c><00:00:45.360><c> the</c><00:00:45.680><c> down</c><00:00:46.000><c> payment</c>

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
is should you move the down payment
 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.750 align:start position:0%
is should you move the down payment
requirement<00:00:48.079><c> from</c><00:00:48.680><c> 20%</c><00:00:49.680><c> to</c><00:00:50.520><c> 10%.</c><00:00:51.520><c> That</c>

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
requirement from 20% to 10%. That
 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.189 align:start position:0%
requirement from 20% to 10%. That
wouldn't<00:00:52.199><c> introduce</c><00:00:53.199><c> much</c>

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't introduce much
 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.630 align:start position:0%
wouldn't introduce much
risk.<00:00:55.199><c> So</c><00:00:55.520><c> think</c><00:00:55.680><c> about</c><00:00:55.840><c> that</c><00:00:56.079><c> for</c><00:00:56.239><c> a</c><00:00:56.480><c> moment</c>

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.069 align:start position:0%
risk. So think about that for a moment
here.<00:00:57.520><c> when</c><00:00:57.840><c> you</c><00:00:58.079><c> have</c>
