was<00:13:22.240><c> you</c><00:13:22.320><c> know</c><00:13:22.480><c> the</c><00:13:22.600><c> three</c><00:13:22.880><c> flag</c><00:13:23.240><c> Theory</c><00:13:23.519><c> and</c>

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
was you know the three flag Theory and
 

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.230 align:start position:0%
was you know the three flag Theory and
then<00:13:23.680><c> it</c><00:13:23.760><c> became</c><00:13:23.959><c> the</c><00:13:24.120><c> five</c><00:13:24.399><c> flag</c><00:13:24.720><c> Theory</c><00:13:25.079><c> and</c>

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
then it became the five flag Theory and
 

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
then it became the five flag Theory and
now<00:13:25.680><c> I</c><00:13:25.800><c> think</c><00:13:26.000><c> that</c><00:13:26.199><c> people</c><00:13:26.440><c> just</c><00:13:26.560><c> wanted</c><00:13:26.760><c> to</c>

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
now I think that people just wanted to
 

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.310 align:start position:0%
now I think that people just wanted to
