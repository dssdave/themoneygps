00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 align:start position:0%

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.850 align:start position:0%
board yet and that is to take gold from
the<00:00:38.969><c> oceans</c><00:00:39.450><c> so</c><00:00:39.960><c> there</c><00:00:40.140><c> is</c><00:00:40.260><c> a</c><00:00:40.290><c> miniscule</c>

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
the oceans so there is a miniscule
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.490 align:start position:0%

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.040 align:start position:0%

and<00:00:43.739><c> if</c><00:00:44.489><c> they</c><00:00:44.700><c> develop</c><00:00:45.000><c> a</c><00:00:45.210><c> technology</c><00:00:45.870><c> to</c>

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 align:start position:0%
and if they develop a technology to
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.220 align:start position:0%
and if they develop a technology to
basically<00:00:46.500><c> go</c><00:00:47.250><c> through</c><00:00:47.280><c> and</c><00:00:47.820><c> mill</c><00:00:48.480><c> it</c><00:00:48.510><c> they</c>

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 align:start position:0%
basically go through and mill it they
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
basically go through and mill it they
would<00:00:49.410><c> be</c><00:00:49.440><c> able</c><00:00:49.770><c> to</c><00:00:50.039><c> reach</c><00:00:50.660><c> 771</c><00:00:51.660><c> trillion</c>

to worth it but should they be able to
