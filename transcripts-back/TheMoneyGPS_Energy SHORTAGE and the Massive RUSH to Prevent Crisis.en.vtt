lot of that out of the ground but then
 

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.910 align:start position:0%
lot of that out of the ground but then
there's<00:09:29.320><c> a</c><00:09:29.480><c> 25%</c><00:09:30.200><c> tariff</c><00:09:30.600><c> on</c><00:09:30.800><c> top</c><00:09:31.000><c> of</c><00:09:31.360><c> that</c><00:09:32.360><c> well</c>
