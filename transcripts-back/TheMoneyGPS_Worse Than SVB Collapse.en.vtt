00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
so all the big Banks so the expectation
 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.430 align:start position:0%
so all the big Banks so the expectation
here<00:06:20.960><c> is</c><00:06:21.080><c> that</c><00:06:21.199><c> they're</c><00:06:21.360><c> going</c><00:06:21.479><c> to</c><00:06:21.599><c> have</c><00:06:21.720><c> some</c>

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
here is that they're going to have some
 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.909 align:start position:0%
here is that they're going to have some

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%
failures and uh the last time we saw
 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.469 align:start position:0%
failures and uh the last time we saw
this<00:06:25.479><c> uhoh</c><00:06:26.479><c> right</c><00:06:26.759><c> before</c><00:06:27.240><c> svb</c><00:06:28.120><c> failed</c><00:06:29.120><c> and</c><00:06:29.199><c> so</c>

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
this uhoh right before svb failed and so
 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.830 align:start position:0%
this uhoh right before svb failed and so
so<00:06:29.639><c> they</c><00:06:29.880><c> can</c><00:06:30.160><c> be</c><00:06:30.919><c> a</c><00:06:31.039><c> little</c><00:06:31.400><c> like</c><00:06:31.599><c> they</c><00:06:31.680><c> can</c>

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
so they can be a little like they can
 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.189 align:start position:0%
