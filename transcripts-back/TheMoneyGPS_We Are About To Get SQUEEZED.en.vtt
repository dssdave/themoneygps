Russia and yet I'm going to show you how
clearly<00:00:49.379><c> it</c><00:00:49.739><c> didn't</c><00:00:49.860><c> work</c><00:00:50.280><c> at</c><00:00:50.820><c> least</c><00:00:50.940><c> in</c><00:00:51.120><c> the</c>

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
clearly it didn't work at least in the
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.049 align:start position:0%
clearly it didn't work at least in the
way<00:00:51.420><c> that</c><00:00:51.600><c> they</c><00:00:51.840><c> hoped</c><00:00:52.379><c> all</c><00:00:53.039><c> right</c><00:00:53.280><c> and</c><00:00:53.879><c> this</c>

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
way that they hoped all right and this
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 align:start position:0%
way that they hoped all right and this
was<00:00:54.360><c> partly</c><00:00:55.079><c> because</c><00:00:55.379><c> of</c><00:00:55.680><c> what</c><00:00:56.039><c> they</c><00:00:56.219><c> did</c><00:00:56.399><c> they</c>

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
was partly because of what they did they
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090 align:start position:0%
was partly because of what they did they
were<00:00:57.480><c> building</c><00:00:57.899><c> pipelines</c><00:00:58.680><c> they</c><00:00:58.920><c> were</c>

building all these
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.170 align:start position:0%
building all these
um<00:01:01.020><c> things</c><00:01:01.559><c> that</c><00:01:01.860><c> would</c><00:01:02.100><c> put</c><00:01:02.699><c> them</c><00:01:02.940><c> through</c>

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
um things that would put them through
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 align:start position:0%
um things that would put them through
into<00:01:03.719><c> even</c><00:01:04.320><c> more</c><00:01:04.559><c> Reliance</c><00:01:05.100><c> on</c><00:01:05.339><c> Russia</c>
