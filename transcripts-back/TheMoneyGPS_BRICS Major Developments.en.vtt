defaulting so we'll see what happens uh
stimulus<00:04:08.560><c> is</c><00:04:09.079><c> going</c><00:04:09.280><c> to</c><00:04:09.439><c> be</c><00:04:09.760><c> key</c><00:04:10.400><c> to</c><00:04:10.720><c> paper</c>

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
stimulus is going to be key to paper
 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.990 align:start position:0%

over the problems that they have right
now<00:04:13.680><c> and</c><00:04:13.799><c> so</c><00:04:14.200><c> if</c><00:04:14.400><c> we</c><00:04:14.599><c> see</c><00:04:15.000><c> that</c><00:04:15.200><c> stimulus</c><00:04:16.120><c> it</c>

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
now and so if we see that stimulus it
 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.030 align:start position:0%
now and so if we see that stimulus it

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
will look positive and even though it's
