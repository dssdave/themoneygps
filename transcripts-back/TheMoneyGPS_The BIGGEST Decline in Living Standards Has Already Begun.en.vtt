often now it's hard to move up a level
very<00:07:07.960><c> difficult</c><00:07:08.120><c> so</c><00:07:08.280><c> a</c><00:07:08.400><c> lot</c><00:07:08.560><c> of</c><00:07:08.720><c> people</c><00:07:09.039><c> they</c>

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
they want to maybe I could become a

they want to maybe I could become a

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
doctor maybe can become an engineer and
 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.550 align:start position:0%
doctor maybe can become an engineer and
a<00:07:13.479><c> lawyer</c><00:07:14.280><c> and</c><00:07:14.360><c> so</c><00:07:14.560><c> then</c><00:07:14.759><c> I</c><00:07:14.840><c> can</c><00:07:15.000><c> move</c><00:07:15.199><c> up</c><00:07:15.400><c> a</c>

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
a lawyer and so then I can move up a
 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.510 align:start position:0%
a lawyer and so then I can move up a
level<00:07:16.440><c> but</c><00:07:16.599><c> for</c><00:07:16.840><c> most</c><00:07:17.160><c> people</c><00:07:17.759><c> they</c><00:07:18.000><c> can't</c><00:07:18.280><c> do</c>

that<00:07:19.400><c> that</c><00:07:19.560><c> doesn't</c><00:07:20.080><c> happen</c><00:07:21.080><c> and</c><00:07:21.240><c> so</c><00:07:21.560><c> they</c><00:07:21.800><c> end</c>

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen and so they end
 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.309 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen and so they end
up<00:07:22.680><c> becoming</c><00:07:23.360><c> what</c><00:07:23.560><c> we</c><00:07:23.800><c> have</c><00:07:24.440><c> in</c><00:07:24.599><c> a</c><00:07:24.840><c> lot</c><00:07:25.080><c> of</c>
